<p><span class="smcap">Dear Lady Londesborough</span>,</p>

<p>The object of the following pages is to supply what appeared to
be a want in our popular literature. We have histories of England, and
histories of the Middle Ages, but none of them give us a sufficient picture
of the domestic manners and sentiments of our forefathers at different
periods, a knowledge of which, I need hardly insist, is necessary to enable
us to appreciate rightly the motives with which people acted, and the
spirit which guided them. The subject, too, must have an interest for
many classes of readers, who will be glad to learn something of the
manners of former days, if it were only to see the contrast with those
of our own time, and to discover in them the origin of many of the
characteristics of modern society. Copious and valuable books have been
published in our language on the history of costume, on that of domestic
architecture, on military antiquities, on the history of religious rites and
ceremonies, and on other kindred subjects, which enable the artist to
clothe his personages correctly; but these would form, after all, but the
disjointed skeleton of a picture, without that further, and perhaps more
important, sort of information which is furnished in the following pages,
and which will enable him to give life to his composition. I have not
attempted to compose a very learned or very elaborate book. The subject
is an immensely wide one as regards the materials, during a large portion
of the period which I include; and to treat it completely would require
the close study of the whole mass of the medi√¶val literature of Western
Europe, edited or inedited, and of the whole mass of the monuments of
medi√¶val art. But my aim has been to bring together a sufficient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
number of plain facts, in a popular form, to enable the general reader to
form a correct view of English manners and sentiments in the middle
ages, and I can venture to claim for my book at least the merit of being
the result of original research. It is not a compilation from writers who
have written on the subject before.</p>

<p>There are at least two ways of arranging a work like this. I might
have taken each particular division of the subject, one after the other, and
traced it separately through the period of history which this volume
embraces; or the whole subject might be divided into historical periods,
in each of which all the different phases of social history for that period
are included. Each of these plans has its advantages and defects. In
the first, the reader would perhaps obtain a clearer notion of the history
of any particular division of the subject, as of the history of the table and
of diet, or of games and amusements, or the like, but at the same time
it would have required a certain effort of comparison and study to arrive
at a clear view of the general question at a particular period. The second
furnishes this general view, but entails a certain amount of what might
almost be called repetition. I have chosen the latter plan, because I think
this repetition will be found to be only apparent, and it seems to me the
best arrangement for a popular book.</p>

<p>The division of periods, too, is, on the whole, natural, and not
arbitrary. During the Anglo-Saxon period, the social system, however
developed or modified from time to time, was strictly that of our own
Anglo-Saxon forefathers, and was the undoubted groundwork of our
own. The Norman conquest brought in foreign social manners and
sentiments totally different from those of the Anglo-Saxons, which for a
time predominated, but became gradually incorporated with the Anglo-Saxon
manners and spirit, until, towards the end of the twelfth century,
they formed the English of the middle ages. The Anglo-Norman
period, therefore, may be considered as an age of transition&mdash;it may
perhaps be described as that of the struggle between the spirit of Anglo-Saxon
society and feudalism. The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries
may be considered in regard to society as the English middle ages&mdash;the
age of feudalism in its English form&mdash;and therefore hold properly the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
largest space in this volume. The fifteenth century forms again a distinct
period in the history of society&mdash;it was that of the decline and breaking
up of feudalism, the close of the middle ages. At the Reformation, we
come to a new transition period&mdash;the transition from medi√¶val to modern
society. This, for several reasons, I regard rather as a conclusion, than as
an integral part, of the history contained in the following pages, and I
therefore give only a light sketch of it, noticing some of its prominent
characteristics. The materials, at this late period, become so extensive,
and so full of interest, that its history admits of several divisions, each of
which is sufficient for an important book, and I leave them to future
researches. One period, that of the English Commonwealth, is perhaps
of greater interest to us at the present time than any other, because it
was that which totally overthrew the traditions of the middle ages,
and inaugurated English society as it now exists. I know that the
history of society at that period has been studied most profoundly by a
friend who is, in all respects, far more capable of treating it than myself,
Mr. Hepworth Dixon, and from whom I trust we may look forward to
a work on the subject, which will be a most valuable addition to the
historical literature of our time. Knowing that he has been working on
this interesting subject, I have treated this period very slightly. I should
be sorry to let my weeds grow upon his flowers.</p>

<p>A portion of the matter contained in this volume has already appeared
in a series of papers in the <i>Art-Journal</i>, but this portion has not only
been carefully revised and partly re-written, but so much addition has
been made, that I believe that more than half the present volume is
entirely new, and the whole may fairly be considered as a new book. I
ought to add that one chapter, that on medi√¶val cookery (chapter xvi.)
and the brief notices of the history of the horse in the middle ages, first
appeared in papers, contributed by the author to the <i>London Review</i>. It
must be stated, too, that the illustrations to my chapter on medi√¶val
minstrelsies were originally engraved for a series of papers on the minstrels,
by the Rev. E. L. Cutts, published in the <i>Art-Journal</i>, and that
I have to thank that gentleman for the ready willingness with which he
has allowed me to use them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span></p>

<p>In conclusion, dear Lady Londesborough, I need hardly say that the
study of the histories of the people (instead of that of their rulers) has
always been a favourite study with me; and that in these researches on
medi√¶val social manners and history, I have always received the warm
sympathy and encouragement of the late Lord Londesborough and of
your Ladyship. In his Lordship I have lost a respected and valued friend,
to whose learned appreciation of the subject of medi√¶val manners and
medi√¶val art I could always have recourse with trust and satisfaction, with
whom I have often conversed on the subjects treated of in the present
volume, and whose extensive and invaluable collection of objects of art of
the medi√¶val period, and of that of the renaissance, furnished a never-ending
source of information and pleasure. It is therefore with feelings
of great personal gratification that I profit by your kind permission to
dedicate this volume to your Ladyship.</p>

ARRANGEMENT OF A SAXON HOUSE.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Much</span> has been written at different times on the costume and some
other circumstances connected with the condition of our forefathers
in past times, but no one has undertaken with much success to treat
generally of the domestic manners of the middle ages. The history
of domestic manners, indeed, is a subject, the materials of which are
exceedingly varied, widely scattered, and not easily brought together;
they, of course, vary in character with the periods to which they relate,
and at certain periods are much rarer than at others. But the interest of
the subject must be felt by every one who appreciates art; for what
avails our knowledge of costume unless we know the manners, the mode
of living, the houses, the furniture, the utensils, of those whom we have
learnt how to clothe? and, without this latter knowledge, history itself
can be but imperfectly understood.</p>

<p>In England, as in most other countries of western Europe, at the
period of the middle ages when we first become intimately acquainted
with them, the manners and customs of their inhabitants were a mixture
of those of the barbarian settlers themselves, and of those which they
found among the conquered Romans; the latter prevailing to a greater
or less extent, according to the peculiar circumstances of the country.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
This was certainly the case in England among our Saxon forefathers;
and it becomes a matter of interest to ascertain what were really the
types which belonged to the Saxon race, and to distinguish them from
those which they derived from the Roman inhabitants of our island.</p>

<p>We have only one record of the manners of the Saxons before they
settled in Britain, and that is neither perfect, nor altogether unaltered&mdash;it
is the romance of Beowulf, a poem in pure Anglo-Saxon, which contains
internal marks of having been composed before the people who
spoke that language had quitted their settlements on the Continent.
Yet we can hardly peruse it without suspecting that some of its portraitures
are descriptive rather of what was seen in England than of what
existed in the north of Germany. Thus we might almost imagine that
the ‚Äústreet variegated with stones‚Äù (<i>str√¶t w≈ìs st√¢n-f√°h</i>), along which
the hero Beowulf and his followers proceeded from the shore to the royal
residence of Hrothgar, was a picture of a Roman road as found in
Britain.</p>

<p>It came into the mind of Hrothgar, we are told, that he would cause
to be built a house, ‚Äúa great mead-hall,‚Äù which was to be his chief
palace, or metropolis. The hall-gate, we are informed, rose aloft, ‚Äúhigh
and curved with pinnacles‚Äù (<i>he√°h and horn-ge√°p</i>). It is elsewhere
described as a ‚Äúlofty house;‚Äù the hall was high; it was ‚Äúfast within and
without, with iron bonds, forged cunningly;‚Äù it appears that there were
steps to it, and the roof is described as being variegated with gold; the
walls were covered with tapestry (<i>web √¶fter wagum</i>), which also was
‚Äúvariegated with gold,‚Äù and presented to the view ‚Äúmany a wondrous
sight to every one that looketh upon such.‚Äù The walls appear to have
been of wood; we are repeatedly told that the roof was carved and lofty;
the floor is described as being variegated (probably a tesselated pavement);
and the seats were benches arranged round it, with the exception
of Hrothgar‚Äôs chair or throne. In the vicinity of the hall stood the
chambers or bowers, in which there were beds (<i>bed √¶fter b√∫rum</i>).</p>

<p>These few epithets and allusions, scattered through the poem, give us
a tolerable notion of what the house of a Saxon chieftain must have been
in the country from whence our ancestors came, as well as afterwards in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
that where they finally settled. The romantic story is taken up more
with imaginary combats with monsters, than with domestic scenes, but it
contains a few incidents of private life. The hall of king Hrothgar was
visited by a monster named Grendel, who came at night to prey upon its
inhabitants; and it was Beowulf‚Äôs mission to free them from this nocturnal
scourge. By direction of the primeval coast-guards, he and his
men proceeded by the ‚Äústreet‚Äù already mentioned to the hall of Hrothgar,
at the entrance to which they laid aside their armour and left their
weapons. Beowulf found the chief and his followers drinking their ale
and mead, and made known the object of his journey. ‚ÄúThen,‚Äù says
the poem, ‚Äúthere was for the sons of the Geats (Beowulf and his
followers), altogether, a bench cleared in the beer-hall; there the bold
of spirit, free from quarrel, went to sit; the thane observed his office, he
that in his hand bare the twisted ale-cup; he poured the bright sweet
liquor; meanwhile the poet sang serene in Heorot (the name of Hrothgar‚Äôs
palace), there was joy of heroes.‚Äù Thus the company passed their
time, listening to the bard, boasting of their exploits, and telling their
stories, until Wealtheow, Hrothgar‚Äôs queen, entered and ‚Äúgreeted the
men in the hall.‚Äù She now served the liquor, offering the cup first to
her husband, and then to the rest of the guests, after which she seated
herself by Hrothgar, and the festivities continued till it was time to retire
to bed. Beowulf and his followers were left to sleep in the hall&mdash;‚Äúthe
wine-hall, the treasure-house of men, variegated with vessels‚Äù (<i>f√¶ttum
f√°hne</i>). Grendel came in the night, and after a dreadful combat received
his death-wound from Beowulf. The noise in the hall was great; ‚Äúa
fearful terror fell on the North Danes, on each of those who from the
walls heard the outcry.‚Äù These were the watchmen stationed on the
wall forming the chieftain‚Äôs palace, that enclosed the whole mass of
buildings (<i>of wealle</i>).</p>

<p>As far as we can judge by the description given in the poem, Hrothgar
and his household in their bowers or bed-chambers had heard little of the
tumult, but they went early in the morning to the hall to rejoice in
Beowulf‚Äôs victory. There was great feasting again in the hall that day,
and Beowulf and his followers were rewarded with rich gifts. After
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
dinner the minstrel again took up the harp, and sang some of the
favourite histories of their tribe. ‚ÄúThe lay was sung, the song of the
gleeman, the joke rose again, the noise from the benches grew loud, cup-bearers
gave the wine from wondrous vessels.‚Äù Then the queen, ‚Äúunder
a golden crown,‚Äù again served the cup to Hrothgar and Beowulf. She
afterwards went as before to her seat, and ‚Äúthere was the costliest of
feasts, the men drank wine,‚Äù until bed-time arrived a second time.
While their leader appears to have been accommodated with a chamber,
Beowulf‚Äôs men again occupied the hall. ‚ÄúThey bared the bench-planks;
it was spread all over with beds and bolsters; at their heads they
set their war-rims, the bright shield-wood; there, on the bench, might
easily be seen, above the warrior, his helmet lofty in war, the ringed
mail-shirt, and the solid shield; it was their custom ever to be ready for
war, both in house and in field.‚Äù</p>

<p>Grendel had a mother (it was the primitive form of the legend of the
devil and his dam), and this second night she came unexpectedly to
avenge her son, and slew one of Hrothgar‚Äôs favourite counsellors and
nobles, who must therefore have also slept in the hall. Beowulf and his
warriors next day went in search of this new marauder, and succeeded in
destroying her, after which exploit they returned to their own home
laden with rich presents.</p>

<p>These sketches of early manners, slight as they may be, are invaluable
to us, in the absence of all other documentary record during several ages,
until after the Anglo-Saxons had been converted to Christianity. During
this long period we have, however, one source of invaluable information,
though of a restricted kind&mdash;the barrows or graves of our primeval forefathers,
which contain almost every description of article that they used
when alive. In that solitary document, the poem of Beowulf, we are
told of the arms which the Saxons used, of the dresses in which they
were clad; of the rings, and bracelets, and ornaments, of which they
were proud; of the ‚Äúsolid cup, the valuable drinking-vessel,‚Äù from which
they quaffed the mead, or the vases from which they poured it; but we
can obtain no notions of the form or character of these articles. From
the graves, on the contrary, we obtain a perfect knowledge of the form
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
and design of all these various articles, without deriving any knowledge
as to the manner in which they were used. The subject now becomes a
more extensive one; and in the Anglo-Saxon barrows in England, we
find a mixture, in these articles, of Anglo-Saxon and Roman, which
furnishes a remarkable illustration of the mixture of the races. We are
all perfectly well acquainted with Roman types; and in the few examples
which can be here given of articles found in early Anglo-Saxon barrows,
I shall only introduce such as will enable us to judge what classes of the
subsequent medi√¶val types were really derived from pure Saxon or
Teutonic originals.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n1" src="images/i_n1.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 1. Anglo-Saxon Drinking Glasses.</i></p></div>

<p>It is curious enough that the poet who composed the romance of
Beowulf enumerates among the treasures in the ancient barrow, guarded
by the dragon who was finally slain by his hero, ‚Äúthe dear, or precious
drinking-cup‚Äù (<i>dryncf√¶t de√≥re</i>). Drinking-cups are frequently found in
the Saxon barrows or graves in England. A group, representing the
more usual forms, is given in our cut, <a href="#n1">No. 1</a>, found chiefly in barrows in
Kent, and preserved in the collections of lord Londesborough and
Mr. Rolfe, the latter of which is now in the possession of Mr. Mayer, of
Liverpool. The example to the left no doubt represents the ‚Äútwisted‚Äù
pattern, so often mentioned in Beowulf, and evidently the favourite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
ornament among the early Saxons. All these cups are of glass; they
are so formed that it is evident they could not stand upright, so that it
was necessary to empty them at a draught. This characteristic of the
old drinking-cups is said to have given rise to the modern name of
tumblers.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img id="n2" src="images/i_n2.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 2. Germano-Saxon Drinking Glasses.</i></p></div>

<p>That these glass drinking-cups&mdash;or, if we like to use the term, these
glasses&mdash;were implements peculiar to the Germanic race to which the
Saxons belonged, and not derived from the Romans, we have corroborative
evidence in discoveries made on the Continent. I will only take
examples from some graves of the
same early period, discovered at Selzen,
in Rhenish Hesse, an interesting
account of which was published at
Maintz, in 1848, by the brothers
W. and L. Lindenschmit. In these
graves several drinking-cups were
found, also of glass, and resembling
in character the two middle figures
in our cut, <a href="#n1">No. 1</a>. Three specimens
are given in the cut <a href="#n2">No. 2</a>. In our
cut, <a href="#n5">No. 5</a>, (<a href="#Page_8">see page 8</a>), is one of
the cup-shaped glasses, also found in these Hessian graves, which closely
resembles that given in the cut <a href="#n1">No. 1</a>. None of the cups of the champagne-glass
form, like those found in England, occur in these foreign
barrows.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 4. Germano-Saxon Pottery.</i></p></div>

<p>We shall find also that the pottery of the later Anglo-Saxon period
presented a mixture of forms, partly derived from those which had belonged
to the Saxon race in their primitive condition, and partly copied or
imitated from those of the Romans. In fact, in our Anglo-Saxon graves
we find much purely Roman pottery intermingled with earthen vessels
of Saxon manufacture; and this is also the case in Germany. As Roman
forms are known to every one, we need only give the pure Saxon types.
Our cut, <a href="#n3">No. 3</a>, represents five examples, and will give a sufficient notion
of their general character. The two to the left were taken, with a large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
quantity more, of similar character, from a Saxon cemetery at Kingston,
near Derby; the vessel in the middle, and the upper one to the right,
are from Kent; and the lower one to the right is also from the cemetery
at Kingston. Several of these were usually considered as types of ancient
British pottery, until their real character was recently demonstrated, and
it is corroborated by the discovery of similar pottery in what I will term
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
the Germano-Saxon graves. Four examples from the cemetery at Selzen,
are given in the cut <a href="#n4">No. 4</a>. We have here not only the rude-formed
vessels with lumps on the side, but also the characteristic ornament of
crosses in circles. The next cut, <a href="#n5">No.
5</a>, represents two earthen vessels of
another description, found in the
graves at Selzen. The one to the
right is evidently the prototype of
our modern pitcher. I am informed
there is, in the Museum at Dover, a
specimen of pottery of this shape,
taken from an Anglo-Saxon barrow
in that neighbourhood; and Mr.
Roach Smith took fragments of
another from an Anglo-Saxon tumulus
near the same place. The other variation of the pitcher here
given is remarkable, not on account of similar specimens having been
found, as far as I know, in graves in England, but because vessels of a
similar form are found rather commonly in the Anglo-Saxon illuminated
manuscripts. One of these is given in the group <a href="#n6">No. 6</a>, which represents
three types of the later Anglo-Saxon
pottery, selected from a large number
copied by Strutt from Anglo-Saxon
manuscripts. The figure to
the left, in this group, is a later
Saxon form of the pitcher; perhaps
the singular form of the handle may
have originated in an error of the
draughtsman.</p>

<p>Among the numerous articles of all kinds found in the early Anglo-Saxon
graves, are bowls of metal (generally bronze or copper), often very
thickly gilt, and of elegant forms; they are, perhaps, borrowed from the
Romans. Three examples are given in the cut <a href="#n7">No. 7</a>, all found in Kent.
They were probably intended for the service of the table. Another class
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
of utensils found rather commonly in the Anglo-Saxon barrows are
buckets. The first of those represented in our cut, <a href="#n8">No. 8</a>, was found in
a Saxon barrow near Marlborough,
in Wiltshire; the other was found
on the Chatham lines. As far as
my own experience goes, I believe
these buckets are usually found with
male skeletons, and from this circumstance,
and the fact of their being
usually ornamented, I am inclined to
think they served some purposes connected
with the festivities of the hall;
probably they were used to carry
the ale or mead. The Anglo-Saxon
translation of the Book of Judges (ch. vii. ver. 20), rendered <i>hydrias
confregissent</i> by <i>to-br√¶con tha bucas</i>, ‚Äúthey broke the buckets.‚Äù A common
name for this implement, which was
properly <i>buc</i>, was <i>√¶scen</i>, which signified
literally a vessel made of ash,
the favourite wood of the Anglo-Saxons.
Our cut, <a href="#n9">No. 9</a>, represents
a bucket of wood with very delicately-formed
bronze hoops and handle,
found in a barrow in Bourne
Park, near Canterbury. The wood was entirely decayed; but the
hoops and handle are in the collection of lord Londesborough. Such
buckets have, also, been found under similar circumstances on the
Continent. The close resemblance between the weapons and other
instruments found in the English barrows and in those at Selzen, may
be illustrated by a comparison of the two axes represented in the cut,
<a href="#n10">No. 10</a>. The upper one was found at Selzen; the lower one is in
the Museum of Mr. Rolfe, and was obtained from a barrow in the Isle
of Thanet. The same similarity is observed between the knives, which
is the more remarkable, as the later Anglo-Saxon knives were quite of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
different form. The example, cut <a href="#n11">No. 11</a>, taken from a grave at Selzen,
is the only instance I know of a knife of this early period of Saxon history
with the handle preserved; it has been beautifully enamelled. This
may be taken as the type of the primitive Anglo-Saxon knife.</p>

<p>Having given these few examples of the general forms of the implements
in use among the Saxons before their conversion to Christianity, as
much to illustrate their manners as described by Beowulf, as to show
what classes of types were originally Saxon, we will proceed to treat of
their domestic manners as we learn them from the more numerous and
more definite documents of a later period. We shall find it convenient
to consider the subject separately as it regards in-door life and out-door
life, and it will be proper first that we should form some definite notion
of an Anglo-Saxon house.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n11" src="images/i_n11.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 11. Germano-Saxon Knife.</i></p></div>

<p>We can already form some notion of the primeval Saxon mansion
from our brief review of the poem of Beowulf; and we shall find that it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
continued nearly the same down to a late period. The most important
part of the building was the hall, on which was bestowed all the ornamentation
of which the builders and decorators of that early period were
capable. Halls built of stone are alluded to in a religious poem at the
beginning of the Exeter book; yet, in the earlier period at least, there
can be little doubt that the materials of building were chiefly wood.
Around, or near this hall, stood, in separate buildings, the bed-chambers,
or bowers (<i>b√∫r</i>), of which the latter name is only now preserved as
applied to a summer-house in a garden; but the reader of old English
poetry will remember well the common phrase of a <i>bird in bure</i>, a lady
in her bower or chamber. These buildings, and the household offices,
were all grouped within an inclosure, or outward wall, which, I imagine,
was generally of earth, for the Anglo-Saxon word, <i>weall</i>, was applied to
an earthen rampart, as well as to masonry. What is termed in the poem
of Judith, <i>wealles ge√°t</i>, the gate of the wall, was the entrance through
this inclosure or rampart. I am convinced that many of the earth-works,
which are often looked upon as ancient camps, are nothing more than
the remains of the inclosures of Anglo-Saxon residences.</p>

<p>In Beowulf, the sleeping-rooms of Hrothgar and his court seem to
have been so completely detached from the hall, that their inmates did
not hear the combat that was going on in the latter building at night.
In smaller houses the sleeping-rooms were fewer, or none, until we arrive
at the simple room in which the inmates had board and lodging together,
with a mere hedge for its inclosure, the prototype of our ordinary cottage
and garden. The wall served for a defence against robbers and enemies,
while, in times of peace and tranquillity, it was a protection from indiscreet
intruders, for the doors of the hall and chambers seem to have
been generally left open. Beggars assembled round the door of the
wall&mdash;the <i>ostium dom√ªs</i>&mdash;to wait for alms.</p>

<p>The vocabularies of the Anglo-Saxon period furnish us with the
names of most of the parts of the ordinary dwellings. The entrance
through the outer wall into the court, the strength of which is alluded to
in early writers, was properly the gate (<i>ge√°t</i>). The whole mass inclosed
within this wall constituted the <i>burh</i> (burgh), or tun, and the inclosed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
court itself seems to have been designated as the <i>cafer-tun</i>, or <i>inburh</i>.
The wall of the hall, or of the internal buildings in general, was called a
<i>wag</i>, or <i>wah</i>, a distinctive word which remained in use till a late period
in the English language, and seems to have been lost partly through the
similarity of sound.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> The entrance to the hall, or to the other buildings
in the interior, was the <i>duru</i>, or door, which was thus distinguished from
the gate. Another kind of door mentioned in the vocabularies was a
<i>hlid-gata</i>, literally a gate with a lid or cover, which was perhaps, however,
a word merely invented to represent the Latin <i>valva</i>, which is given
as its equivalent. The <i>door</i> is described in Beowulf as being ‚Äúfastened
with fire-bands‚Äù (<i>fyr-bendum f√¶st</i>, I. 1448), which must mean iron bars.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
Either before the door of the hall, or between the door and the interior
apartment, was sometimes a <i>selde</i>, literally a shed, but perhaps we might
now call it a portico. The different parts of the architectural structure of
the hall enumerated in the vocabularies are <i>stapul</i>, a post or log set in the
ground; <i>stipere</i>, a pillar; <i>beam</i>, a beam; <i>r√¶fter</i>, a rafter; <i>l√¶ta</i>, a lath;
<i>swer</i>, a column. The columns supported <i>bigels</i>, an arch or vault, or
<i>fyrst</i>, the interior of the roof, the ceiling. The <i>hrof</i>, or roof, was called
also <i>thecen</i>, or <i>th√¶cen</i>, a word derived from the verb <i>theccan</i>, to cover; but
although this is the original of our modern word <i>thatch</i>, our readers must
not suppose that the Anglo-Saxon <i>th√¶cen</i> meant what we call a thatched
roof, for we have the Anglo-Saxon word <i>th√¶c-tigel</i>, a thatch-tile, as well
as <i>hrof-tigel</i>, a roof-tile. There was sometimes one story above the
ground-floor, for which the vocabularies give the Latin word <i>solarium</i>,
the origin of the later medi√¶val word, <i>soler</i>; but it is evident that this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
was not common to Anglo-Saxon houses, and the only name for it was
<i>up-flor</i>, an upper floor. It was approached by a <i>st√¶ger</i>, so named from
the verb <i>stigan</i>, to ascend, and the origin of our modern word <i>stair</i>.
There were windows to the hall, which were probably improvements
upon the ruder primitive Saxon buildings, for the only Anglo-Saxon words
for a window are <i>eag-thyrl</i>, an eye-hole, and <i>eag-duru</i>, an eye-door.</p>

<p>We have unfortunately no special descriptions of Anglo-Saxon houses,
but scattered incidents in the Anglo-Saxon historians show us that this
general arrangement of the house lasted down to the latest period of their
monarchy. Thus, in the year 755, Cynewulf, king of the West Saxons,
was murdered at Merton by the atheling Cyneard. The circumstances
of the story are but imperfectly understood, unless we bear in mind the
above description of a house. Cynewulf had gone to Merton privately,
to visit a lady there, who seems to have been his mistress, and he only
took a small party of his followers with him. Cyneard, having received
information of this visit, assembled a body of men, entered the inclosure
of the house unperceived (as appears by the context), and surrounded the
detached chamber (<i>b√∫r</i>) in which was the king with the lady. The
king, taken by surprise, rushed to the door (<i>on tha duru eode</i>), and was
there slain fighting. The king‚Äôs attendants, although certainly within
the inclosure of the house, were out of hearing of this sudden fray (they
were probably in the hall), but they were roused by the woman‚Äôs screams,
rushed to the spot, and fought till, overwhelmed by the numbers of their
enemies, they also were all slain. The murderers now took possession of
the house, and shut the entrance gate of the wall of inclosure, to protect
themselves against the body of the king‚Äôs followers who had been left at
a distance. These, next day, when they heard what had happened,
hastened to the spot, attacked the house, and continued fighting around
the gate (<i>ymb th√° gatu</i>) until they made their way in, and slew all the
men who were there. Again, we are told, in the Ramsey Chronicle
published by Gale, of a rich man in the Danish period, who was oppressive
to his people, and, therefore, suspicious of them. He accordingly
had four watchmen every night, chosen alternately from his household,
who kept guard at the outside of his hall, evidently for the purpose of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
preventing his enemies from being admitted into the inclosure by
treachery. He lay in his chamber, or bower. One night, the watchmen
having drunk more than usual, were unguarded in their speech, and
talked together of a plot into which they had entered against the life of
their lord. He, happening to be awake, heard their conversation from
his chamber, and defeated their project. We see here the chamber of
the lord of the mansion so little substantial in its construction that its
inmates could hear what was going on out of doors. At a still later
period, a Northumbrian noble, whom Hereward visited in his youth, had
a building for wild beasts within his house or inclosure. One day a bear
broke loose, and immediately made for the chamber or bower of the lady
of the household, in which she had taken shelter with her women, and
whither, no doubt, the savage animal was attracted by their cries. We
gather from the context that this asylum would not have availed them,
had not young Hereward slain the bear before it reached them. In fact,
the lady‚Äôs chamber was still only a detached room, probably with a very
weak door, which was not capable of withstanding any force.</p>

<p>The Harleian Manuscript, No. 603 (in the British Museum), contains
several illustrations of Anglo-Saxon domestic architecture, most of which
are rather sketchy and indefinite; but there is one picture (fol. 57, v<sup>o</sup>.)
which illustrates, in a very interesting manner, the distribution of the house.
Of this, an exact copy is given in the accompanying cut, <a href="#n12">No. 12</a>.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The
manuscript is, perhaps, as old as the ninth century, and the picture here
given illustrates Psalm cxi., in the Vulgate version, the description of
the just and righteous chieftain: the beggars are admitted within the
inclosure (where the scene is laid), to receive the alms of the lord; and
he and his lady are occupied in distributing bread to them, while his
servants are bringing out of one of the bowers raiment to clothe the
naked. The larger building behind, ending in a sort of round tower
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
with a cupola, is evidently the hall&mdash;the stag‚Äôs head seems to mark its
character. The buildings to the left are chambers or bowers; to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
right is the domestic chapel, and the little room attached is perhaps the
chamber of the chaplain.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n12" src="images/i_n12.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 12. Anglo-Saxon Mansion.</i></p></div>

<p>It is evidently the intention in this picture to represent the walls of
the rooms as being formed, in the lower part, of masonry, with timber
walls above, and all the windows are in the timber walls. If we make
allowance for want of perspective and proportion in the drawing, it is
probable that only a small portion of the elevation was masonry, and that
the wooden walls (<i>parietes</i>) were raised above it, as is very commonly the
case in old timber-houses still existing. The greater portion of the Saxon
houses were certainly of timber; in Alfric‚Äôs colloquy, it is the carpenter,
or worker in wood (<i>se treo-wyrhta</i>), who builds houses; and the very
word to express the operation of building, <i>timbrian</i>, <i>getimbrian</i>, signified
literally to construct of timber. We observe in the above representation
of a house, that none of the buildings have more than a ground-floor,
and this seems to have been a characteristic of the houses of all
classes. The Saxon word <i>fl√≥r</i> is generally used in the early writers to
represent the Latin <i>pavimentum</i>. Thus the ‚Äúvariegated floor‚Äù (<i>on f√°gre
fl√≥r</i>) of the hall mentioned in Beowulf (l. 1454) was a paved floor,
perhaps a tessellated pavement; as the road spoken of in an earlier part
of the poem (<i>str√¶t w√¶s st√°n-f√°h</i>, the street was stone-variegated, l. 644)
describes a paved Roman road. The term upper-floor occurs once or
twice, but only I think in translating from foreign Latin writers. The
only instance that occurs to my memory of an upper-floor in an Anglo-Saxon
house, is the story of Dunstan‚Äôs council at Calne in 978, when,
according to the Saxon Chronicle, the <i>witan</i>, or council, fell from an
upper-floor (<i>of ane √∫p-floran</i>), while Dunstan himself avoided their fate
by supporting himself on a beam (<i>uppon anum beame</i>). The buildings in
the above picture are all roofed with tiles of different forms, evidently
copied from the older Roman roof-tiles. Perhaps the flatness of these
roofs is only to be considered as a proof of the draughtsman‚Äôs ignorance of
perspective. One of Alfric‚Äôs homilies applies the epithet <i>steep</i> to a roof&mdash;<i>on
tham sticelan hrofe</i>. The hall is not unfrequently described as lofty.</p>

<p>The collective house had various names in Anglo-Saxon. It was
called <i>h√∫s</i>, a house, a general term for all residences great or small; it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
was called <i>heal</i>, or hall, because that was the most important part of the
building&mdash;we still call gentlemen‚Äôs seats halls; it was called <i>ham</i>, as
being the residence or home of its possessor; and it was called <i>t√∫n</i>, in
regard of its inclosure.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxons chose for their country-houses a position which
commanded a prospect around, because such sites afforded protection at
the same time that they enabled the possessor to overlook his own landed
possessions. The Ramsey Chronicle, describing the beautiful situation of
the mansion at ‚ÄúSchitlingdonia‚Äù (Shitlington), in Bedfordshire, tells us
that the surrounding country lay spread out like a panorama from the
door of the hall&mdash;<i>ubi ab ostio aul√¶ tota fere villa et late patens ager arabilis
oculis subjacet intuentis</i>.

SAXON MEAL.&mdash;PROVISIONS AND COOKERY.&mdash;AFTER-DINNER
OCCUPATIONS.&mdash;DRUNKEN BRAWLS.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> introductory observations in the preceding chapter will be
sufficient to show that the mode of life, the vessels and utensils,
and even the residences of the Anglo-Saxons, were a mixture of those
they derived from their own forefathers with those which they borrowed
from the Romans, whom they found established in Britain. It is interesting
to us to know that we have retained the ordinary forms of
pitchers and basins, and, to a certain degree, of drinking vessels, which
existed so many centuries ago among our ancestors before they established
themselves in this island. The beautiful forms which had been brought
from the classic south were not able to supersede national habit. Our
modern houses derive more of their form and arrangement from those of
our Saxon forefathers than from any other source. We have seen that the
original Saxon arrangement of a house was preserved by that people to the
last; but it does not follow that they did not sometimes adopt the Roman
houses they found standing, although they seem never to have imitated
them. I believe Bulwer‚Äôs description of the Saxonised Roman house inhabited
by Hilda, to be founded in truth. Roman villas, when uncovered
at the present day, are sometimes found to have undergone alterations
which can only be explained by supposing that they were made when later
possessors adapted them to Saxon manners. Such alterations appear to me
to be visible in the villa at Hadstock, in Essex, opened by the late lord
Braybrooke; in one place the outer wall seems to have been broken through
to make a new entrance, and a road of tiles, which was supposed to have
been the bottom of a water course, was more probably the paved pathway
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
made by the Saxon possessor. Houses in those times were seldom
of long duration; we learn from the domestic anecdotes given in saints‚Äô
legends and other writings, that they were very frequently burnt by
accidental fires; thus the main part of the house, the timber-work, was
destroyed; and as ground was then not valuable, and there was no want
of space, it was much easier to build a new house in another spot, and
leave the old foundations till they were buried in rubbish and earth, than
to clear them away in order to rebuild on the same site. Earth soon
accumulated under such circumstances; and this accounts for our finding,
even in towns, so much of the remains of the houses of an early period
undisturbed at a considerable depth under the present surface of the
ground.</p>

<p>It has already been observed that the most important part of the
Saxon house was the hall. It was the place where the household (<i>hired</i>)
collected round their lord and protector, and where the visitor or stranger
was first received,&mdash;the scene of hospitality. The householder there held
open-house, for the hall was the public apartment, the doors of which
were never shut against those who, whether known or unknown, appeared
worthy of entrance. The reader of Saxon history will remember the
beautiful comparison made by one of king Edwin‚Äôs chieftains in the
discussion on the reception to be given to the missionary Paulinus. ‚ÄúThe
present life of man, O king, seems to me, in comparison of that time
which is unknown to us, like to the swift flight of a sparrow through
the hall where you sit at your meal in winter, with your chiefs and
attendants, warmed by a fire made in the middle of the hall, whilst storms
of rain or snow prevail without; the sparrow, flying in at one door and
immediately out at another, whilst he is visible is safe from the wintry
storm, but after this short space of fair weather, he immediately vanishes
out of your sight, into the dark winter from which he had emerged.‚Äù
Dining in private was always considered disgraceful, and is mentioned as
a blot in a man‚Äôs character.</p>

<p>Internally, the walls of the hall were covered with hangings or
tapestry, which were called in Anglo-Saxon <i>wah-hr√¶gel</i>, or <i>wah-rift</i>,
wall-clothing. These appear sometimes to have been mere plain cloths,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
but at other times they were richly ornamented, and not unfrequently
embroidered with historical subjects. So early as the seventh century,
Aldhelm speaks of the hangings or curtains being dyed with purple and
other colours, and ornamented with images, and he adds that ‚Äúif finished
of one colour uniform they would not seem beautiful to the eye.‚Äù
Among the Saxon wills printed by Hickes, we find several bequests of
<i>heall wah-riftas</i>, or wall-tapestries for the hall; and it appears that, in
some cases, tapestries of a richer and more precious character than those
in common use were reserved to be hung up only on extraordinary
festivals. There were hooks, or pegs, on the wall, upon which various
objects were hung for convenience. In an anecdote told in the contemporary
life of Dunstan, he is made to hang his harp against the wall of
the room. Arms and armour, more especially, were hung against the
wall of the hall. The author of the ‚ÄúLife of Hereward‚Äù describes the
Saxon insurgents who had taken possession of Ely, as suspending their
arms in this manner; and in one of the riddles in the Exeter Book, a
war-vest is introduced speaking of itself thus:&mdash;</p>

</span></p>

<p>We have no allusion in Anglo-Saxon writers to chimneys, or fireplaces,
in our modern acceptation of the term. When necessary, the
fire seems to have been made on the floor, in the place most convenient.
We find instances in the early saints‚Äô legends where the hall was burnt
by incautiously lighting the fire too near the wall. Hence it seems to
have been usually placed in the middle, and there can be little doubt
that there was an opening, or, as it was called in later times, a louver, in
the roof above, for the escape of the smoke. The historian Bede describes
a Northumbrian king, in the middle of the seventh century, as having,
on his return from hunting, entered the hall with his attendants, and all
standing round the fire to warm themselves. A somewhat similar scene,
but in more humble life, is represented in the accompanying cut, taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
from a manuscript calendar of the beginning of the eleventh century
(MS. Cotton. Julius, A. iv.). The material for feeding the fire is
wood, which the man to the left is bringing from a heap, while his
companion is administering to the
fire with a pair of Saxon tongs
(<i>tangan</i>). The vocabularies give
<i>tange</i>, tongs, and <i>bylig</i>, bellows;
and they speak of <i>col</i>, coal (explained
by the Latin <i>carbo</i>), and
<i>synder</i>, a cinder (<i>scorium</i>). As all
these are Saxon words, and not
derived from the Latin, we may suppose that they represent things
known to the Anglo-Saxon race from an early period; and as charcoal
does not produce <i>scorium</i>, or cinder, it is perhaps not going too far to
suppose that the Anglo-Saxons were acquainted with the use of mineral
coal. We know nothing of any other fire utensils, except that the
Anglo-Saxons used a <i>fyr-scofl</i>, or fire-shovel. The place in which the
fire was made was the <i>heorth</i>, or hearth.</p>

<div class="figright"><img id="n13" src="images/i_n13.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 13. A Party at the Fire.</i></p></div>

<p>The furniture of the hall appears to have been very simple, for it
consisted chiefly of benches. These had carpets and cushions; the former
are often mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon wills. The Anglo-Saxon poems
speak of the hall as being ‚Äúadorned with treasures,‚Äù from which we are
perhaps justified in believing that it was customary to display there in
some manner or other the richer and more ornamental of the household
vessels. Perhaps one end of the hall was raised higher than the rest for
the lord of the household, like the <i>dais</i> of later times, as Anglo-Saxon
writers speak of the <i>heah-setl</i>, or high seat. The table can hardly be
considered as furniture, in the ordinary sense of the word: it was literally,
according to its Anglo-Saxon name <i>bord</i>, a board that was brought out
for the occasion, and placed upon tressels, and taken away as soon as the
meal was ended. Among the inedited Latin <i>√¶nigmata</i>, or riddles, of
the Anglo-Saxon writer Tahtwin, who flourished at the beginning of the
eighth century, is one on a <i>table</i>, which is curious enough to be given
here, from the manuscript in the British Museum (MS. Reg. 12, C. xxiii.).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
The table, speaking in its own person, says that it is in the habit of
feeding people with all sorts of viands; that while so doing it is a quadruped,
and is adorned with handsome clothing; that afterwards it is
robbed of all it possesses, and when it has been thus robbed it loses its
legs:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the illuminated manuscripts, wherever dinner scenes are represented,
the table is always covered with what is evidently intended for a
handsome table-cloth, the <i>myse-hr√¶gel</i> or <i>bord-clath</i>. The grand preparation
for dinner was <i>laying the board</i>; and it is from this original
character of the table that we derive our ordinary expression of receiving
any one ‚Äúto <i>board</i> and lodging.‚Äù</p>

<p>The hall was peculiarly the place for eating&mdash;and for drinking. The
Anglo-Saxons had three meals in the day,&mdash;the breaking of their fast
(breakfast), at the third hour of the day, which answered to nine o‚Äôclock
in the morning, according to our reckoning; the <i>ge-reordung</i> (repast), or
<i>n√≥n-mete</i> (noon-meat) or dinner, which is stated to have been held at
the canonical hour of noon, or three o‚Äôclock in the afternoon; and the
<i>√¶fen-gereord</i> (evening repast), <i>√¶fen-gyfl</i> (evening food), <i>√¶fen-mete</i> (evening
meat), <i>√¶fen-thenung</i> (evening refreshment), or supper, the hour of
which is uncertain. It is probable, from many circumstances, that the
latter was a meal not originally in use among our Saxon forefathers:
perhaps their only meal at an earlier period was the dinner, which was
always their principal repast; and we may, perhaps, consider noon as
midday, and not as meaning the canonical hour.</p>

<p>As I have observed before, the table, from the royal hall down to the
most humble of those who could afford it, was not refused to strangers.
When they came to the hall-door, the guests were required to leave their
arms in the care of a porter or attendant, and then, whether known or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
not, they took their place at the tables. One of the laws of king Cnut
directs, that if, in the meantime, any one took the weapon thus deposited,
and did hurt with it, the owner should be compelled to clear
himself of suspicion of being cognisant of the use to be made of his arms
when he laid them down. History affords us several remarkable instances
of the facility of approach even to the tables of kings during the Saxon
period. It was this circumstance that led to the murder of king Edmund
in 946. On St. Augustin‚Äôs day, the king was dining at his manor of
Pucklechurch, in Gloucestershire; a bandit named Leofa, whom the king
had banished for his crimes, and who had returned without leave from
exile, had the effrontery to place himself at the royal table, by the side
of one of the principal nobles of the court; the king alone recognised
him, rose from his seat to expel him from the hall, and received his
death-wound in the struggle. In the eleventh century, when Hereward
went in disguise as a spy to the court of a Cornish chieftain, he entered
the hall while they were feasting, took his place among the guests, and
was but slightly questioned as to who he was and whence he came.</p>

<p>In the early illuminated manuscripts, dinner scenes are by no means
uncommon. The cut, <a href="#n14">No. 14</a> (taken from Alfric‚Äôs version of Genesis,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
MS. Cotton. Claudius, B. iv., fol. 36, v<sup>o</sup>), represents Abraham‚Äôs feast on
the birth of his child. The guests are sitting at an ordinary long hall
table, ladies and gentlemen being mixed together without any apparent
special arrangement. This manuscript is probably of the beginning of
the eleventh century. The cut, <a href="#n15">No. 15</a>, represents another dinner scene,
from a manuscript probably of the tenth century (Tiberius, C. vi., fol. 5,
v<sup>o</sup>), and presents several peculiarities. The party here is a very small
one, and they sit at a round table. The attendants seem to be serving
them, in a very remarkable manner, with roast meats, which they bring
to table on the spits (<i>spitu</i>) as they were roasted. Another festive scene
is represented in the cut, <a href="#n16">No. 16</a>, taken from a manuscript of the Psychomachia
of the poet Prudentius (MS. Cotton. Cleopatra, C. viii., fol. 15, r<sup>o</sup>).
The table is again a round one, at which Luxury and her companions are
seated at supper (<i>seo Galnes √¶t hyre √¶fen-ge-reordum sitt</i>).</p>

<p>It will be observed that in these pictures, the tables are tolerably well
covered with vessels of different kinds, with the exception of plates.
There are one or two dishes of different sizes in <a href="#n14">fig. 14</a>, intended, no doubt,
for holding bread and other articles; it was probably an utensil borrowed
from the Romans, as the Saxon name <i>disc</i> was evidently taken from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
Latin <i>discus</i>. It is not easy to identify the forms of vessels given in these
pictures with the words which are found in the Anglo-Saxon language,
in which the general term for a vessel is <i>f√¶t</i>, a vat; <i>crocca</i>, a pot or
pitcher, no doubt of earthenware, is preserved in the modern English word
crockery; and <i>bolla</i>, a bowl, <i>orc</i>, a basin, <i>bledu</i> and <i>mele</i>, each answering
to the Latin <i>patera</i>, <i>l√¶fel</i> and <i>ceac</i>, a pitcher or urn, <i>hn√¶p</i>, a cup (identical
in name with the <i>hanap</i> of a later period), <i>flaxe</i>, a flask, are all pure
Anglo-Saxon words. Many of the forms represented in the manuscripts
are recognised at once as identical with those which are found in the
earlier Anglo-Saxon graves. In the vocabularies, the Latin word <i>amphora</i>
is translated by <i>crocca</i>, a crock; and <i>lagena</i> by <i>√¶scen</i>, which means
a vessel made of ash wood, and was, in all probability, identical with the
small wooden buckets so often found in the early Saxon graves. In a
document preserved in Heming‚Äôs chartulary of Canterbury, mention is
made of ‚Äúan <i>√¶scen</i>, which is otherwise called a back-bucket‚Äù (<i>√¶scen the
is othre namon hrygilebuc gecleopad</i>, Heming, p. 393), which strongly confirms
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
the opinion I have adopted as to the purpose of the bucket found
in the graves.</p>

<p>The food of the Anglo-Saxons appears to have been in general rather
simple in character, although we hear now and then of great feasts,
probably consisting more in the quantity of provisions than in any great
variety or refinement in gastronomy. Bread formed the staple, which
the Anglo-Saxons appear to have eaten in great quantities, with milk,
and butter, and cheese. A domestic was termed a man‚Äôs <i>hlaf-√¶tan</i>, or
loaf-eater. There is a curious passage in one of Alfric‚Äôs homilies, that on
the life of St. Benedict, where, speaking of the use of oil in Italy, the
Anglo-Saxon writer observes, ‚Äúthey eat oil in that country with their
food as we do butter.‚Äù Vegetables (<i>wyrtan</i>) formed a considerable
portion of the food of our forefathers at this period; beans (<i>beana</i>) are
mentioned as articles of food, but I remember no mention of the eating
of peas (<i>pisan</i>) in Anglo-Saxon writers. A variety of circumstances show
that there was a great consumption of fish, as well as of poultry. Of
flesh meat, bacon (<i>spic</i>) was the most abundant, for the extensive oak
forests nourished innumerable droves of swine. Much of their other
meat was salted, and the place in which the salt meat was kept was
called, on account of the great preponderance of the bacon, a <i>spic-hus</i>, or
bacon-house; in latter times, for the same reason, named the larder.
The practice of eating so much salt meat explains why boiling seems to
have been the prevailing mode of cooking it. In the manuscript of
Alfric‚Äôs translation of Genesis, already mentioned, we have a figure of a
boiling vessel (<a href="#n17">No. 17</a>), which is placed over the fire on a tripod. This vessel
was called a pan (<i>panna</i>&mdash;one Saxon writer mentions <i>isen panna</i>, an iron
pan) or a kettle (<i>cytel</i>). It is very curious to observe how many of our
trivial expressions at the present day are derived from very ancient customs;
thus, for example, we speak of ‚Äúa kettle of fish,‚Äù though what we now
term a kettle would hardly serve for this branch of cookery. In another
picture (<a href="#n18">No. 18</a>) we have a similar boiling vessel, placed similarly on a tripod,
while the cook is using a very singular utensil to stir the contents. Bede
speaks of a goose being taken down from a wall to be <i>boiled</i>. It seems
probable that in earlier times among the Anglo-Saxons, and perhaps at a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
later period, in the case of large feasts, the cooking was done out of doors.
The only words in the Anglo-Saxon language for cook and kitchen, are
<i>c√≥c</i> and <i>cycene</i>, taken from the Latin <i>coquus</i> and <i>coquina</i>, which seems to
show that they only improved their rude manner of living in this respect
after they had become acquainted with the Romans. Besides boiled
meats, they certainly had roast, or broiled, which they called <i>br√¶de</i>, meat
which had been spread or displayed to the fire. The vocabularies explain
the Latin <i>coctus</i> by ‚Äúboiled or baked‚Äù (<i>gesoden</i>, <i>gebacen</i>). They also
fried meat, which was then called <i>hyrstyng</i>, and the vessel in which it
was fried was called <i>hyrsting-panne</i>, a frying-pan. Broth, also (<i>broth</i>),
was much in use.</p>

<p>In the curious colloquy of Alfric (a dialogue made to teach the
Anglo-Saxon youth the Latin names for different articles), three professions
are mentioned as requisite to furnish the table: first, the salter,
who stored the store-rooms (<i>cleafan</i>) and cellars (<i>hedderne</i>), and without
whom they could not have butter (<i>butere</i>)&mdash;they always used salt butter&mdash;or
cheese (<i>cyse</i>); next, the baker, without whose handiwork, we are
told, every table would seem empty; and lastly, the cook. The work of
the latter appears not at this time to have been very elaborate. ‚ÄúIf you
expel me from your society,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúyou will be obliged to eat your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
vegetables green, and your flesh-meat raw, nor can you have any fat
broth.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe care not,‚Äù is the reply, ‚Äúfor we can ourselves cook our
provisions, and spread them on the table.‚Äù Instead of grounding his
defence on the difficulties of his profession, the cook represents that in
this case, instead of having anybody to wait upon them, they would be
obliged to be their own servants. It may be observed, as indicating the
general prevalence of boiling food, that in the above account of the cook,
the Latin word <i>coquere</i> is rendered by the Anglo-Saxon <i>seothan</i>, to boil.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
Our words <i>cook</i> and <i>kitchen</i> are the Anglo-Saxon <i>c√≥c</i> and <i>cycene</i>, and have
no connection with the French <i>cuisine</i>.</p>

<p>We may form some idea of the proportions in the consumption of
different kinds of provisions among our Saxon forefathers, by the quantities
given on certain occasions to the monasteries. Thus, according to
the Saxon Chronicle, the occupier of an estate belonging to the abbey of
Medeshamstede (Peterborough) in 852, was to furnish yearly sixty loads
of wood for firing, twelve of coal (<i>gr√¶fa</i>), six of fagots, two tuns of pure
ale, two beasts fit for slaughter, six hundred loaves, and ten measures of
Welsh ale.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n19" src="images/i_n19.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 19. Anglo-Saxons at Table.</i></p></div>

<p>It will be observed in the dinner scenes given above, that the guests
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
are helping themselves with their hands. Forks were totally unknown to
the Anglo-Saxons for the purpose of carrying the food to the mouth, and
it does not appear that every one at table was furnished with a knife.
In the cut, <a href="#n19">No. 19</a> (taken from MS. Harl. No. 603, fol. 12, r<sup>o</sup>.), a party
at table are eating without forks or knives. It will be observed here, as
in the other pictures of this kind, that the Anglo-Saxon bread (<i>hlaf</i>) is in
the form of round cakes, much like the Roman loaves in the pictures at
Pompeii, and not unlike our cross-buns at Easter, which are no doubt
derived from our Saxon forefathers. Another party at dinner without
knives or forks is represented in the cut <a href="#n20">No. 20</a>, taken from the same
manuscript (fol. 51, v<sup>o</sup>.). The tables here are without table-cloths. The
use of the fingers in eating explains to us why it was considered necessary
to wash the hands before and after the meal.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n20" src="images/i_n20.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 20. Anglo-Saxons at Table.</i></p></div>

<p>The knife (<i>cnif</i>), as represented in the Saxon illuminations, has a
peculiar form, quite different from that of the earlier knife found in the
graves, but resembling rather closely the form of the modern razor.
Several of these Saxon knives have been found, and one of them, dug up
in London, and now in the interesting museum collected by Mr. Roach
Smith, is represented in the accompanying cut, <a href="#n21">No. 21</a>.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> The blade, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
steel (<i>style</i>), which is the only part preserved, has been inlaid with
bronze.</p>

<p>When the repast was concluded, and the hands of the guests washed,
the tables appear to have been withdrawn from the hall, and the party
commenced drinking. From the earliest times, this was the occupation
of the after part of the day, when no warlike expedition or pressing
business hindered it. The lord and his chief guests sat at the high seat,
while the others sat round on benches. An old chronicler, speaking of a
Saxon dinner party, says, ‚Äúafter dinner they went to their cups, to which
the English were very much accustomed.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> This was the case even
with the clergy, as we learn from many of the ecclesiastical laws. In the
Ramsey History printed by Gale, we are told of a Saxon bishop who
invited a Dane to his house in order to obtain some land from him, and
to drive a better bargain, he determined to make him drunk. He therefore
pressed him to stay to dinner, and ‚Äúwhen they had all eaten enough,
the tables were taken away, and they passed the rest of the day, till
evening, drinking. He who held the office of cup-bearer, managed that
the Dane‚Äôs turn at the cup came round oftener than the others, as the
bishop had directed him.‚Äù We know by the story of Dunstan and king
Eadwy, that it was considered a great mark of disrespect to the guests,
even in a king, to leave the drinking early after dinner.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n21" src="images/i_n21.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 21. An Anglo-Saxon Knife.</i></p></div>

<p>Our cut, <a href="#n22">No. 22</a>, taken from the Anglo-Saxon calendar already mentioned
(MS. Cotton. Julius, A. vi.), represents a party sitting at the
<i>heah-setl</i>, the high seat, or dais, drinking after dinner. It is the lord of
the household and his chief friends, as is shown by their attendant guard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
of honour. The cup-bearer, who is serving them, has a napkin in his
hand. The seat is furnished with cushions, and the three persons seated
on it appear to have large napkins or cloths spread over their knees.
Similar cloths are evidently represented in our cut <a href="#n16">No. 16</a>. Whether
these are the <i>setl-hr≈ìgel</i>, or seat-cloths, mentioned in some of the Anglo-Saxon
wills, is uncertain.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n22" src="images/i_n22.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 22. An Anglo-Saxon Drinking Party.</i></p></div>

<p>It will be observed that the greater part of the drinking-cups bear a
resemblance in form to those of the more ancient period which we find
in Anglo-Saxon graves, and of which some examples have been given in
the preceding chapter. We cannot tell whether those seen in the
pictures be intended for glass or other material; but it is certain that the
Anglo-Saxons were ostentatious of drinking-cups and other vessels made
of the precious metals. Sharon Turner, in his History of the Anglo-Saxons,
has collected together a number of instances of such valuable
vessels. In one will, three silver cups are bequeathed; in another, four
cups, two of which were of the value of four pounds; in another, four
silver cups, a cup with a fringed edge, a wooden cup variegated with
gold, a wooden knobbed cup, and two very handsome drinking-cups
(<i>smicere scencing-cuppan</i>). Other similar documents mention a golden
cup, with a golden dish; a gold cup of immense weight; a dish adorned
with gold, and another with Grecian workmanship (probably brought
from Byzantium). A lady bequeathed a golden cup weighing four marks
and a half. Mention of silver cups, silver basins, &amp;c., is of frequent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
occurrence. In 833, a king gave his gilt cup, engraved outside with
vine-dressers fighting dragons, which he called his cross-bowl, because it
had a cross marked within it, and it had four angles projecting, also like a
cross. These cups were given frequently as marks of affection and
remembrance. The lady Ethelgiva presented to the abbey of Ramsey,
among other things, ‚Äútwo silver cups, for the use of the brethren in the
refectory, in order that, while drink is served in them to the brethren at
their repast, my memory may be more firmly imprinted on their hearts.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
It is a curious proof of the value of such vessels, that in the pictures of
warlike expeditions, where two or three articles are heaped together as a
kind of symbolical representation of the value of the spoils, vessels of the
table and drinking-cups and drinking-horns are
generally included. Our cut, <a href="#n23">No. 23</a>, represents
one of these groups (taken from the Cottonian
Manuscript, Claudius, C. viii.); it contains a crown,
a bracelet or ring, two drinking-horns, a jug, and
two other vessels. The drinking-horn was in common
use among the Anglo-Saxons. It is seen on
the table or in the hands of the drinkers in more
than one of our cuts. In the will of one
Saxon lady, two buffalo-horns are mentioned;
three horns worked with gold and silver are mentioned
in one inventory; and we find four horns
enumerated among the effects of a monastic house. The Mercian king
Witlaf, with somewhat of the sentiment of the lady Ethelgiva, gave
to the abbey of Croyland the horn of his table, ‚Äúthat the elder monks
may drink from it on festivals, and in their benedictions remember sometimes
the soul of the donor.‚Äù</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 23. Articles of Value.</i></p></div>

<p>The liquors drunk by the Saxons were chiefly ale and mead; the
immense quantity of honey that was then produced in this country, as we
learn from Domesday-book and other records, shows us how great must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
have been the consumption of the latter article. Welsh ale is especially
spoken of. Wine was also in use, though it was an expensive article,
and was in a great measure restricted to persons above the common rank.
According to Alfric‚Äôs Colloquy, the merchant brought from foreign
countries wine and oil; and when the scholar is asked why he does not
drink wine, he says he is not rich enough to buy it, ‚Äúand wine is not the
drink of children or fools, but of elders and wise men.‚Äù There were,
however, vineyards in England in the times of the Saxons, and wine was
made from them; but they were probably rare, and chiefly attached to
the monastic establishments. William of Malmesbury speaks of a vineyard
attached to his monastery, which was first planted at the beginning
of the eleventh century by a Greek monk who settled there, and who
spent all his time in cultivating it.</p>

<p>In their drinking, the Anglo-Saxons had various festive ceremonies,
one of which is made known to us by the popular story of the lady
Rowena and the British king. When the ale or wine was first served,
the drinkers pledged each other, with certain phrases of wishing health,
not much unlike the mode in which we still take wine with each other
at table, or as people of the less refined classes continue to drink the first
glass to the health of the company; but among the Saxons the ceremony
was accompanied with a kiss. In our cut, <a href="#n14">No. 14</a>, the party appear to be
pledging each other.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 25. An Anglo-Saxon Fithelere.</i></p></div>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon potations were accompanied with various kinds of
amusements. One of these was telling stories, and recounting the
exploits of themselves or of their friends. Another was singing their
national poetry, to which the Saxons were much attached. In the less
elevated class, where professed minstrels were not retained, each guest
was minstrel in his turn. C√¶dmon, as his story is related by Bede,
became a poet through the emulation thus excited. One of the ecclesiastical
canons enacted under king Edgar enjoins ‚Äúthat no priest be a
minstrel at the ale (<i>ealu-sc√≥p</i>), nor in any wise act the gleeman (<i>gliwige</i>),
with himself or with other men.‚Äù In the account of the murder of
king Ethelbert in Herefordshire, by the treachery of Offa‚Äôs wicked queen
(<small>A.D.</small> 792), we are told that the royal party, after dinner, ‚Äúspent the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
whole day with music and dancing in great glee.‚Äù The cut, <a href="#n24">No. 24</a>
(taken from the Harl. MS., No. 603), is a perfect illustration of this
incident of Saxon story. The cup-bearer is serving the guest with wine
from a vessel which is evidently a Saxon imitation of the Roman
amphora; it is perhaps the Anglo-Saxon <i>sester</i> or <i>s√¶ster</i>; a word, no
doubt, taken from the Latin sextarius, and carrying with it, in general,
the notion of a certain measure. In Saxon translations from the Latin,
<i>amphora</i> is often rendered by <i>sester</i>. We have here a choice party of
minstrels and gleemen. Two are occupied with the harp, which appears,
from a comparison of Beowulf with the later writers, to have been the
national instrument. It is not clear from the picture
whether the two men are playing both on the same
harp, or whether one is merely holding the instrument
for the other. Another is perhaps intended
to represent the Anglo-Saxon <i>fithelere</i>, playing on
the <i>fithele</i> (the modern English words <i>fiddler</i> and
<i>fiddle</i>); but his instrument appears rather to be the
cittern, which was played with the fingers, not with
the bow. Another representation of this performer,
from the same manuscript, is given in the cut <a href="#n25">No. 25</a>,
where the instrument is better defined. The other two minstrels, in <a href="#n24">No. 24</a>,
are playing on the horn, or on the Saxon <i>pip</i>, or pipe. The two dancers
are evidently a man and a woman, and another lady to the extreme right
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
seems preparing to join in the same exercise. We know little of the
Anglo-Saxon mode of dancing, but to judge by the words used to express
this amusement, <i>hoppan</i> (to hop), <i>saltian</i> and <i>stellan</i> (to leap), and <i>tumbian</i>
(to tumble), it must have been accompanied with violent movements.
Our cut <a href="#n26">No. 26</a> (from the Cottonian MS., Cleopatra, C. viii. fol. 16, v<sup>o</sup>),
represents another party of minstrels, one of whom, a female, is dancing,
while the other two are playing on a kind of cithara and on the Roman
double flute. The Anglo-Saxon names for the different kinds of musicians
most frequently spoken of were <i>hearpere</i>, the harper; <i>bymere</i>, the
trumpeter; <i>pipere</i>, the player on the pipe or flute; <i>fithelere</i>, the fiddler;
and <i>horn-blawere</i>, the horn-blower. The <i>gligman</i>, or <i>gleeman</i>, was the
same who, at a later period, was called, in Latin, <i>joculator</i>, and, in
French, a <i>jougleur</i>; and another performer, called <i>truth</i>, is interpreted
as a stage player, but was probably some performer akin to the gleeman.
The harp seems to have stood in the highest rank, or, at least, in the
highest popularity, of musical instruments; it was termed poetically the
<i>gle√≥-beam</i>, or the glee-wood.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n26" src="images/i_n26.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 26. Anglo-Saxon Minstrels.</i></p></div>

<p>Although it was considered a very fashionable accomplishment among
the Anglo-Saxons to be a good singer of verses and a good player on the
harp, yet the professed minstrel, who went about to every sort of joyous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
assemblage, from the festive hall to the village wake, was a person not
esteemed respectable. He was beneath consideration in any other light
than as affording amusement, and as such he was admitted everywhere,
without examination. It was for this reason that Alfred, and subsequently
Athelstan, found such easy access in this garb to the camps of
their enemies; and it appears to have been a common disguise for such
purposes. The group given in the last cut (<a href="#n26">No. 26</a>) are intended to represent
the persons characterised in the text (of Prudentius) by the Latin
word <i>ganeones</i> (vagabonds, ribalds), which is there glossed by the Saxon
term gleemen (<i>ganeonum</i>, <i>gliwig-manna</i>). Besides music and dancing,
they seem to have performed a variety of tricks and jokes, to while away
the tediousness of a Saxon afternoon, or excite the coarse mirth of the
peasant. That such performers, resembling in many respects the Norman
jougleur, were usually employed by Anglo-Saxons of wealth and rank, is
evident from various allusions to them. Gaimar has preserved a curious
Saxon story of the murder of king Edward by his stepmother (<small>A.D.</small> 978),
in which the queen is represented as having in her service a dwarf
minstrel, who is employed to draw the young king alone to her house.
According to the Anglo-Norman relator of this story, the dwarf was
skilled in various modes of dancing and tumbling, characterised by words
of which we can hardly now point out the exact distinction, ‚Äúand could
play many other games.‚Äù</p>

<p>In a Saxon manuscript in the British Museum (MS. Cotton. Tiberius,
C. vi.), among the minstrels attendant on king David (represented in
our cut, <a href="#n27">No. 27</a>), we see a gleeman, who is throwing up and catching
knives and balls, a common performance of the later Norman jougleurs,
as well as of our modern mountebanks. Some of the tricks and gestures
of these performers were of the coarsest description, such as could be only
tolerated in a rude state of society. An example will be found in a story
told by William of Malmesbury of wandering minstrels, whom he had seen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
performing at a festival at that monastery when he was a child, and which
we can hardly venture to give even under the veil of the original Latin.
A poem in the Exeter manuscript describes the wandering character of
the Saxon minstrels. He tells us:&mdash;</p>

<p>We are not to suppose that our Anglo-Saxon forefathers remained at
table, merely drinking and listening. On the contrary, the performance
of the minstrels appears to have been only introduced at intervals, between
which the guests talked, joked, propounded and answered riddles, boasted
of their own exploits, disparaged those of others, and, as the liquor took
effect, became noisy and quarrelsome. The moral poems often allude to
the quarrels and slaughters in which feasts ended. One of these poems,
enumerating the various endowments of men, says:&mdash;

<p>There were other amusements for the long evenings besides those
which belonged especially to the hall, for every day was not a feast-day.
The hall was then left to the household retainers and their occupations.
But we must now leave this part of the domestic establishment. The
ladies appear not to have remained at table long after dinner&mdash;it was
somewhat as in modern times&mdash;they proceeded to their own special part
of the house&mdash;the chamber&mdash;and thither it will be my duty to accompany
them in the next chapter. I have described all the ordinary scenes
that took place in the Anglo-Saxon hall.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> bower or chamber, which, as before stated, was, in the original
Saxon mansions, built separate from the hall, was a more
private apartment than the latter, although it was still easy of access.
In the houses of the rich and the noble there were, as may easily be
supposed, several chambers, devoted to the different purposes of the
household, and to the reception of visitors. It was in the chamber that
the lord of the household transacted his private business, and gave his
private audiences. We see by the story of king Edwy that it was considered
a mark of effeminacy to retire from the company in the hall after
dinner, to seek more quiet amusement in the chamber, where the men
rejoined the ladies of the family; yet there are numerous instances which
show that, except on festive occasions, this was a very common practice.
In some cases, where the party was not an ostentatious or public one, the
meal was served in a chamber rather than in the hall. According to the
story of Osbert king of Northumberland and Beorn the buzecarl, as told
by Gaimar, it was in a chamber that Beorn‚Äôs lady received the king,
and caused the meal to be served to him which ended in consequences so
fatal to the country. We have very little information relating to the
domestic games and amusements of the Anglo-Saxons. They seem to
have consisted, in a great measure, in music and in telling stories. They
had games of hazard, but we are not acquainted with their character.
Their chief game was named <i>t√¶fel</i> or <i>t√¶fl</i>, which has been explained by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
<i>dice</i> and by <i>chess</i>; one name of the article played with, <i>t√¶fl-stan</i>, a table-<i>stone</i>,
would suit either interpretation; but another, <i>t√¶fl-mon</i>, a table-<i>man</i>,
would seem to indicate a game resembling our chess.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> The writers
immediately after the conquest speak of the Saxons as playing at chess,
and pretend that they learnt the game from the Danes. Gaimar, who
gives us an interesting story relating to the deceit practiced upon king
Edgar (<small>A.D.</small> 973) by Ethelwold, when sent to visit the beautiful Elfthrida,
daughter of Orgar of Devonshire, describes the young lady and her noble
father as passing the day at chess.</p>

<p>The Ramsey history, published by Gale, describing a bishop‚Äôs visit to

similar games.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> An ecclesiastical canon, enacted under king Edgar,

<p class="caption"><i>No. 28. Anglo-Saxon Chairs.</i></p></div>

<p>It was not usual, in the middle ages, to possess much furniture, for in
those times of insecurity, anything moveable, which could not easily be
concealed, was never safe from plunderers. Benches, on which several
persons could sit together, and a stool or a
chair for a guest of more consideration, were
the only seats. Our word chair is Anglo-Norman,
and the adoption of the name
from that language would seem to indicate
that the moveable to which it was applied
was unknown to the great mass of the
Anglo-Saxon population of the island. The
Anglo-Saxon name for it was <i>setl</i>, a seat,
or <i>stol</i>; the latter preserved in the modern word stool. We find chairs
of different forms in the illuminations of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
they are always represented as the seats of persons of high rank and
dignity, usually of kings. The two examples given in the accompanying
cut (<a href="#n28">No. 28</a>), are taken from the Harleian MS., No. 603, fol. 54, v<sup>o</sup>.,
already referred to in our preceding chapters. It will be observed that,
although very simple in form, they are both furnished with cushions.
The chair in our cut <a href="#n29">No. 29</a>, taken from Alfric‚Äôs translation of Genesis
(MS. Cotton. Claudius, B. iv.), on which a king is seated, is of a different
and more elegant construction. We sometimes find, in the manuscripts,
chairs of fantastic form, which were, perhaps, creations of the artist‚Äôs
imagination. Such a one is the singular throne on which king David is
seated with his harp, in our cut <a href="#n30">No. 30</a>, which is also taken from the
Harleian Manuscript, No. 603 (fol. 68, v<sup>o</sup>.). In addition to the seat, the
ladies in the chamber had a <i>scamel</i>, or footstool.</p>

<p>There was a table used in the chamber or bower, which differed
altogether from that used in the hall. It was named <i>myse</i>, <i>disc</i> (from
the Latin <i>discus</i>), and <i>beod</i>; all words which convey the idea of its being
round&mdash;<i>beodas</i> (in the plural) was the term applied to the scales of a
balance. The Latin phrase, of the 127th Psalm, <i>in circuitu mens√¶ tu√¶</i>,
which was evidently understood by the Anglo-Saxon translators as referring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
to a round table, is translated by one, <i>on ymbhwyrfte mysan thine</i>, and by
another, <i>in ymbhwyrfte beodes thines</i>. If we refer back to the preceding
chapter, we shall see, in the subjects which appear to exhibit a small
domestic party (see cuts <a href="#n15">No. 15</a>, <a href="#n19">19,</a>, and <a href="#n24">24</a>), that the table is round; and
this was evidently the usual form given among the Anglo-Saxons to
the table used in the chamber or private room. This form has been
preserved as a favourite one in England down to a very recent period, as
that of the parlour-table among the class of society most likely to retain
Anglo-Saxon tastes and sentiments. In the pictures, the round table is
generally represented as supported on three or four legs, though there are
instances in which it was represented with one. In the latter case, the
board of the table probably turned up on a hinge, as in our old parlour
tea-tables; and in the former it was perhaps capable of being taken off
the legs; for there is reason for believing that it was only laid out when
wanted, and that, when no longer in use, it was put away on one side of
the room or in a closet, in the smallest possible compass.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img id="n31" src="images/i_n31.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 31. A Lamp and Stand.</i></p></div>

<p>We have no information to explain to us how the bower or chamber
was warmed. In the hall, it is probable that the fire gave warmth and
light at the same time, although, in the fragment of the Anglo-Saxon
poem relating to the fight at Finnesburg, there is an indistinct intimation
that the hall was sometimes lighted with <i>horns</i>, or cressets; but, in the
chamber, during the long evenings of winter, it was necessary to have an
artificial light to enable its occupants to read, or work, or play. The
Anglo-Saxon name for this article, so necessary for domestic comfort, was
<i>candel</i> or <i>condel</i> (our <i>candle</i>); and, so general was the application of this
term, that it was even used figuratively as we now use the word lamp.
Thus, the Anglo-Saxon poets spoke of the sun as <i>rodores candel</i> (the
candle of the firmament), <i>woruld-candel</i> (the candle of the world), <i>heofon-condel</i>
(the candle of heaven), <i>wyn-condel</i> (the candle of glory). The
candle was, no doubt, originally a mere mass of fat plastered round a
wick (<i>candel-weoc</i>), and stuck upon an upright stick. Hence the instrument
on which it was afterwards supported received the name of <i>candel-sticca</i>
or <i>candel-st√¶f</i>, a candlestick; and the original idea was preserved
even when the candle supporter had many branches, it being then called
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
a <i>candel-treow</i>, or candle-tree. The original arrangement of the stick
was also preserved; for, down to a very recent period, the candle was not
inserted in a socket in the candlestick as at present, but it was stuck upon
a spike. The Anglo-Saxon writers speak of <i>candel-snytels</i>, or snuffers.
Other names less used, for a candle or some article for giving light, were
<i>blacern</i> or <i>bl√¶cern</i>, which is explained in glossaries by the Latin <i>lucerna</i>,
and <i>th√¶cela</i>, the latter signifying merely a light. It was usual, also,
among our Saxon forefathers, as among ourselves, to speak of the instrument
for illumination as merely <i>leoht</i>, a light&mdash;‚Äúbring me a light.‚Äù
A candlestick and candle are represented in one of the cuts in our last
chapter (cut <a href="#n19">No. 19</a>). The Anglo-Saxons, no doubt, derived the use of
lamps from the Romans; and they were so utterly at a loss for a word to
describe this mode of illumination, that they always called it
<i>leoht-f√¶t</i>, a light-vat, or vessel of light. In our cut (<a href="#n31">No. 31</a>)
we have an Anglo-Saxon lamp, placed on a candelabrum or
stand, exactly in the Roman manner. It will be remembered
that Asser, a writer of somewhat doubtful authenticity,
ascribes to king Alfred the invention of lanterns, as a protection
to the candle, to prevent it from swealing in consequence
of the wind entering through the crevices of the
apartments&mdash;not a very bright picture of the comforts of an
Anglo-Saxon chamber. The candles were made of wax as
well as tallow. The candlestick was of different materials.
In one instance we find it termed, in Anglo-Saxon, a <i>leoht-isern</i>,
literally a light-iron: perhaps this was the term used for the lamp-stand,
as figured in our last cut. In the inventories we have mention of
<i>ge-bonene candel-sticcan</i> (candlesticks of bone), of silver-gilt candlesticks,
and of ornamented candlesticks.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n32" src="images/i_n32.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 32. Anglo-Saxon Beds.</i></p></div>

<p>A bed was a usual article of furniture in the bower or chamber;
though there were, no doubt, in large mansions, chambers set apart as
bedrooms, as well as chambers in which there was no bed, or in which
a bed could be made for the occasion. The account given by Gaimar,
as quoted above, of the visit of king Osbert to Beorn‚Äôs lady, seems to
imply that the chamber in which the lady gave the king his meal had a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
bed in it. The bed itself seems usually to have consisted merely of a
sack (<i>s√¶ccing</i>) filled with straw, and laid on a bench or board. Hence
words used commonly to signify the bed itself were <i>b√¶nce</i> (a bench), and
<i>streow</i> (straw): and even in king Alfred‚Äôs translation of Bede, the statement,
‚Äúhe ordered to prepare a bed for him,‚Äù is expressed in Anglo-Saxon
by, <i>he heht him streowne ge-gearwian</i>, literally, he ordered to
prepare straw for him. All, in fact, that had to be done when a bed
was wanted, was to take the bed-sack out of the <i>cyst</i>, or chest, fill it with
fresh straw, and lay it on the bench. In ordinary houses it is probable
that the bench for the bed was placed in a recess at the side of the
room, in the manner we still see in Scotland; and hence the bed itself
was called, among other names, <i>cota</i>, a cot; <i>cryb</i>, a crib or stall; and
<i>clif</i> or <i>clyf</i>, a recess or closet. From the same circumstance a bedroom
was called <i>bed-clyfa</i> or <i>bed-cleofa</i>, and <i>bed-cofa</i>, a bed-closet or bed-cove.
Our cut (<a href="#n32">No. 32</a>), taken from Alfric‚Äôs version of Genesis (Claudius, B. iv.),
represents beds of this description. Benches are evidently placed in
recesses at the side of the chamber, with the beds laid upon them, and
the recesses are separated from the rest of the apartment by a curtain,
<i>bed-warft</i> or <i>hryfte</i>. The modern word <i>bedstead</i> means, literally, no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
more than ‚Äúa place for a bed;‚Äù and it is probable that what we call
bedsteads were then rare, and only possessed by people of rank. Two
examples are given in the annexed cut (<a href="#n33">No. 33</a>), taken from the Harleian
MS., No. 603. Under the head were placed a <i>bolstar</i> and a <i>pyle</i>
(pillow), which were probably also stuffed
with straw. The clothes with which the
sleeper was covered, and which appear in the
pictures scanty enough, were <i>scyte</i>, a sheet,
<i>bed-felt</i>, a coverlet, which was generally of
some thicker material, and <i>bed-reaf</i>, bed-clothes.
We know from a multitude of
authorities, that it was the general custom
of the middle ages to go into bed quite
naked. The sketchy character of the Anglo-Saxon
drawings renders it difficult sometimes
to judge of minute details; but, from the
accompanying cuts, it appears that an Anglo-Saxon
going into bed, having stripped all his
or her clothes off, first wrapped round his body a sheet, and then drew
over him the coverlet. Sharon Turner has given a list of the articles
connected with the bed, mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon wills and inventories.
In the will of a man we find bed-clothes (<i>bed-reafes</i>), with a
curtain (<i>hyrfte</i>), and sheet (<i>hopp-scytan</i>), and all that thereto belongs;
and he gives to his son the <i>bed-reafe</i>, or bed-cloth, and all its appurtenances.
An Anglo-Saxon lady gives to one of her children two chests
and their contents, her best bed-curtain, linen, and all the clothes
belonging to it. To another child she leaves two chests, and ‚Äúall the
bed-clothes that to one bed belong.‚Äù On another occasion we read of
<i>pulvinar unum de palleo</i>: not a pillow of straw, as Sharon Turner very
erroneously translates it, but a pillow of a sort of rich cloth made in the
middle ages. A goat-skin bed-covering was sent to an Anglo-Saxon
abbot; and bear-skins are sometimes noticed, as if a part of bed furniture.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img id="n33" src="images/i_n33.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 33. Anglo-Saxon Beds.</i></p></div>

<p>The bed-room, or chamber, and the sitting-room were usually identical;
for we must bear in mind that in the domestic manners of the middle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
ages the same idea of privacy was not connected with the sleeping-room
as at the present day. Gaimar has preserved an anecdote of Anglo-Saxon
times curiously illustrative of this point. King Edgar&mdash;a second
David in this respect&mdash;married the widow of Ethelwold, whom he had
murdered in order to clear his way to her bed. The king and queen
were sleeping in their bed, which is described as surrounded by a rich
curtain, made of a stuff which we cannot easily explain, when Dunstan,
uninvited, but unhindered, entered the chamber to expostulate with
them on their wickedness, and came to the king‚Äôs bedside, where he
stood over them, and entered into conversation&mdash;

In the account of the murder of king Ethelbert by the instrumentality of
the queen of king Offa, as it is told by Roger of Wendover, we see the
queen ordering to be prepared for the royal guest, a chamber, which was
adorned for the occasion with sumptuous furniture, as his bed-room.
‚ÄúNear the king‚Äôs bed she caused a seat to be prepared, magnificently
decked, and surrounded with curtains; and underneath it the wicked
woman caused a deep pit to be dug.‚Äù Into this pit the king was precipitated
the moment he trusted himself on the treacherous seat. It is
clear from the context that the chamber thus prepared for the king was
a building apart, and that it had only a ground-floor.</p>

<p>It was in the chamber that the child, while an infant, was brought
up by its mother. We have few contemporary notices of the treatment
of children at this early age by the Anglo-Saxons, but probably it differed
little from the general practice of a later period. Towards the close of
the thirteenth century, an Englishman named Walter de Bibblesworth,
who wrote, as a great proportion of English writers at that day did, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
French verse&mdash;French as it was then spoken and written in England&mdash;has
left us a very curious metrical vocabulary, compiled in French with
interlinear explanations of the words in English, which commences with
man‚Äôs infancy. ‚ÄúAs soon as the child is born,‚Äù says the author, ‚Äúit must
be swathed; lay it to sleep in its cradle, and you must have a nurse to
rock it to sleep.‚Äù

This was the manner in which the new-born infant was treated in all
grades of society. If we turn to one of the more serious romances, we
find it practised among princes and feudal chiefs equally as among the
poor. Thus, when the princess Parise, wandering in the wild woods, is
delivered in the open air, she first wraps her child in a piece of <i>sendal</i>,
torn apparently from her rich robe, and then binds, or swathels, it with a
white cloth:&mdash;

When the robbers carry away the child by night, thinking they had
gained some rich booty, they find that they have stolen a newly-born
infant, ‚Äúall swatheled.‚Äù

This custom of swatheling children in their infancy, though evidently
injurious as well as ridiculous, has prevailed from a very early period, and
is still practised in some parts of Europe. We can hardly doubt that our
Anglo-Saxon forefathers swatheled their children, although the practice
is not very clearly described by any of their writers. We derive the word
itself from the Anglo-Saxon language, in which <i>beswethan</i> means to
swathe or bind, <i>suethe</i> signifies a band or swathe, and <i>swethel</i> or <i>sw√¶thil</i>,
a swaddling-band. These words appear, however, to have been used in
a more extensive sense among the Anglo-Saxons than their representatives
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
in more recent times, and as I have not met with them applied in this
restricted sense in Anglo-Saxon writers, I should not hastily assume from
them that our early Teutonic forefathers did swathe their new-born
children. In an Anglo-Saxon poem on the birth of Christ, contained in
the Exeter Book (p. 45), the poet speaks of&mdash;

<span class="table">
<span class="trow">
<span class="tcell"><i>Bearnes gebyrda,</i></span>
<span class="tcell"><i>The child‚Äôs birth,</i></span>
</span>
<span class="trow">

<span class="tcell"><i>with cloths wound round.</i></span>
</span></span>

These words refer clearly to the practice of swaddling; and, though the
Anglo-Saxon artist has not here portrayed his object very distinctly, we
can hardly doubt that, in our cut (<a href="#n34">No. 34</a>), taken from the Anglo-Saxon
manuscript of C√¶dmon, the child, which its mother is represented as
holding, is intended to be swathed.</p>

<p>The word <i>bin</i>, used in the lines of the Anglo-Saxon poem just quoted,
which means a hutch or a manger, has reference, of course, to the circumstances
of the birth of the Saviour, and is not here employed to
signify a cradle. This last word is itself Anglo-Saxon, and has stood its
ground in our language successfully against the influence of the Anglo-Norman,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
in which it was called a <i>bers</i> or <i>bersel</i>, from the latter of which
is derived the modern French <i>ber√ßeau</i>. Another name for a cradle was
<i>crib</i>; a poem in the Exeter Book (p. 87) speaks of <i>cild geong on crybbe</i>
(a young child in a cradle). Our cut <a href="#n35">No. 35</a>, also taken from the manuscript
of C√¶dmon, represents an Anglo-Saxon cradle of rather rude construction.
The illuminators of a later period often represent the cradle
of elegant form and richly ornamented. The Anglo-Saxon child appears
here also to be swaddled, but it is still drawn too inaccurately to be
decisive on this point. The latter illuminators were more particular and
correct in their delineations, and leave no doubt of the universal practice
of swaddling infants. A good example is given in our cut <a href="#n36">No. 36</a>, taken
from an illuminated manuscript of the fourteenth century, of which a
copy is given in the large work of the late M. du Sommerard.</p>

<p>There is a very curious paragraph relating to infants in the P≈ìnitentiale
of Theodore, archbishop of Canterbury, which furnishes us with a
singular picture of early Anglo-Saxon domestic life, for Theodore flourished
in the latter half of the seventh century. It may be perhaps right to
explain that a P≈ìnitentiale was a code of ecclesiastical laws directing the
proportional degrees of penance for each particular class and degree of
crimes and offences against public and private morals, and that these laws
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
penetrate to the innermost recesses of domestic life. The P≈ìnitentiale of
archbishop Theodore directs that ‚Äúif a woman place her infant by the
hearth, and the man put water in the cauldron, and it boil over, and the
child be scalded to death, the woman must do penance for her negligence,
but the man is acquitted of blame.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> As this accident must have been
of very frequent occurrence to require a particular direction in a code of
laws, it implies great negligence in the Anglo-Saxon mothers, and seems
to show that, commonly, at least at this early period, they had no cradles
for their children, but laid them, swaddled as they were, on the ground
close by the fire, no doubt to keep them warm, and that they left them
in this situation.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n36" src="images/i_n36.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 36. Mother and Child.</i></p></div>

<p>We are not informed if there were any fixed period during which the
infant was kept in swaddling-cloths, but probably when it was thought
no longer necessary to keep it in the arms or in the cradle, it was relieved
from its bands, and allowed to crawl about the floor and take care of
itself. Walter de Bibblesworth, the Anglo-Norman writer of the thirteenth
century already quoted, tells us briefly that a child is left to creep
about before it has learnt to go on its feet:&mdash;</p>

<p>When the Anglo-Saxon youth, if a boy, had passed his infancy, he
entered that age which was called <i>cnithad</i> (knighthood), which lasted
from about eight years of age until manhood.</p>

<p>It is very rare that we can catch in history a glimpse of the internal
economy of the Anglo-Saxon household. Enough, however, is told to
show us that the Saxon woman in every class of society possessed those
characteristics which are still considered to be the best traits of the
character of Englishwomen; she was the attentive housewife, the tender
companion, the comforter and consoler of her husband and family, the
virtuous and noble matron. Home was her especial place; for we are
told in a poem in the Exeter Book (p. 337) that, ‚ÄúIt beseems a damsel
to be at her board (table); a rambling woman scatters words, she is
often charged with faults, a man thinks of her with contempt, oft her
cheek smites.‚Äù In all ranks, from the queen to the peasant, we find the
lady of the household attending to her domestic duties. In 686, John
of Beverley performed a supposed miraculous cure on the lady of a
Yorkshire earl; and the man who narrated the miracle to Bede the
historian, and who dined with John of Beverley at the earl‚Äôs house after
the cure, said, ‚ÄúShe presented the cup to the bishop (John) and to me,
and continued serving us with drink as she had begun, till dinner was
over.‚Äù Domestic duties of this kind were never considered as degrading,
and they were performed with a simplicity peculiarly characteristic of the
age. Bede relates another story of a miraculous cure performed on an
earl‚Äôs wife by St. Cuthbert, in the sequel of which we find the lady
going forth from her house to meet her husband‚Äôs visitor, holding the
reins while he dismounts, and conducting him in. The wicked and
ambitious queen Elfthrida, when her step-son king Edward approached
her residence, went out in person to attend upon him, and invite him to
enter, and, on his refusal, she served him with the cup herself, and it
was while stooping to take it that he was treacherously stabbed by one
of her attendants. In their chamber, besides spinning and weaving, the
ladies were employed in needlework and embroidery, and the Saxon
ladies were so skilful in this art, that their work, under the name of
English work (<i>opus Anglicum</i>), was celebrated on the continent. We
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
read of a Saxon lady, named Ethelswitha, who retired with her maidens
to a house near Ely, where her mother was buried, and employed herself
and them in making a rich chasuble for the monks. The four princesses,
the sisters of king Ethelstan, were celebrated for their skill in spinning,
weaving, and embroidering; William of Malmesbury tells us that their
father, king Edward, had educated them ‚Äúin such wise, that in childhood
they gave their whole attention to letters, and afterwards employed
themselves in the labours of the distaff and the needle.‚Äù The reader
will remember in the story of the Saxon queen Osburgha, the mother
of the great Alfred, how she sat in her chamber, surrounded by her
children, and encouraging them in a taste for literature. The ladies,
when thus occupied, were not inaccessible to their friends of either sex.
When Dunstan was a youth, he appears to have been always a welcome
visitor to the ladies in their ‚Äúbowers,‚Äù on account of his skill in music
and in the arts. His contemporary biographer tells us of a noble lady,
named Ethelwynn, who, knowing his skill in drawing and designs,
obtained his assistance for the ornaments of a handsome stole which she
and her women were embroidering. Dunstan is represented as bringing
his harp with him into the apartment of the ladies, and hanging it up
against the wall, that he might have it ready to play to them in the
intervals of their work. Editha, the queen of Edward the Confessor,
was well-known as a skilful needle-woman, and as extensively versed in
literature. Ingulf‚Äôs story of his schoolboy-days, if it be true (for there
is considerable doubt of the authenticity of Ingulf‚Äôs ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù), and of
his interviews with queen Edith, gives us a curious picture of the simplicity
of an Anglo-Saxon court, even at the latest period of their
monarchy. ‚ÄúI often met her,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúas I came from school, and
then she questioned me about my studies and my verses; and willingly
passing from grammar to logic, she would catch me in the subtleties of
argument. She always gave me two or three pieces of money, which
were counted to me by her handmaiden, and then sent me to the royal
larder to refresh myself.‚Äù</p>

<p>Several circumstances arising out of certain rivalries of social institutions
render it somewhat difficult to form an estimate of the moral
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
character of the Anglo-Saxons. In the first place, before the introduction
of Christianity, marriage was a mere civil institution, consisted chiefly in a
bargain between the father of the lady and the man who sought her, and
was completed with few formalities, except those of feasting and rejoicing.
After the young lady was out of the control of her parents, the two sexes
were on a footing of equality to each other, and the marriage tie was so
little binding, that, in case of disagreement, it was at the will of either of
the married couple to separate, in which case the relatives or friends of
each party interfered, to see that right was done in the proportional
repayment of marriage money, dowry, &amp;c., and after the separation each
party was at liberty to marry again. This state of things is well illustrated
in the Icelandic story of the Burnt Njal, recently translated by Dr. Dasent,
and it was not abolished by the secular laws, after the conversion of the
Anglo-Saxons to Christianity, marriage still continuing to be, in fact, a
civil institution. But the higher clergy, at least, who were those who
were most strongly inspired with the Romish sentiments, disapproved
entirely of this view of the marriage state, and, although the Saxon priests
appear not to have hesitated in being present at the second marriages
after such separations, they were apparently forbidden by the ecclesiastical
laws from giving their blessing to them.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> With such views of the conjugal
relations, we cannot be surprised if the associating together of a
man and woman, without the ceremonies of marriage, was looked upon
without disgust; in fact, this was the case throughout western Europe
during the middle ages, in spite of the doctrines of the church, and the
offspring was hardly considered as dispossessed of legal rights. It would
be easy to point out examples illustrating this state of things. Again, the
priesthood among the unconverted Saxons was probably, as it appears
among the Icelanders in the story of the Burnt Njal just alluded to, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
sort of family possession,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> the priests themselves being what we should
call family men; so that when the Anglo-Saxon people were Christians,
and no longer pagans, the mass of the clergy, whatever may have been
their sincerity as Christians, could not understand, or, at least, were
unwilling to accept, the new Romish doctrine which required their
celibacy. In both these cases, the Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical writers,
who are our chief authority on this subject, and were the most bigoted
of the Romish party, speak in terms of exaggerated virulence, on the
score of morality, against practices which the Anglo-Saxon people had
not been used to consider as immoral at all. Thus, we should be led to
believe, from the accounts of these ecclesiastical moralists, that the Anglo-Saxon
clergy were infamous for their incontinence, whereas their declamations
probably mean only that the Anglo-Saxon priests persisted in
having wives and families. The secular laws contain frequent allusions
to the continuance of principles relating to the marriage state, which
were derived from the older period of paganism, and some of these are
extremely curious. Thus, the laws of king Ethelred provide that a man
who seduces another man‚Äôs wife, shall make reparation, not only as in
modern times, by paying pecuniary damages, but also by procuring him
another wife! or, in the words of the original, ‚ÄúIf a freeman have been
familiar with a freeman‚Äôs wife, let him pay for it with his <i>wer-gild</i> (the
money compensation for the killing of a man), and provide another wife
with his own money, and bring her home to the other.‚Äù By a law of
king Ine, ‚Äúif any man buy a wife (that is, if the bargain with her father
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
has been completed), and the marriage take not place,‚Äù he was required
to pay the money, besides other compensation. And again, by one of
Alfred‚Äôs laws, it was provided, ‚ÄúIf any one deceive an unbetrothed
woman, and sleep with her, let him pay for her, and have her afterwards
to wife; but if the father of the woman will not give her, let him pay
money according to her dowry.‚Äù Regulations relating to the buying of
a wife, are found in the Anglo-Saxon laws.</p>

<p>We learn nothing in the facts of history to the discredit of the Anglo-Saxon
character in general. As in other countries, in the same condition of
society, they appear capable of great crimes, and of equally great acts of
goodness and virtue. Generally speaking, their least amiable trait was the
treatment of their servants or slaves; for this class among the Anglo-Saxons
were in a state of absolute servitude, might be bought and sold, and had
no protection in the law against their masters and mistresses, who, in fact,
had power of life and death over them. We gather from the ecclesiastical
canons that, at least in the earlier periods of Anglo-Saxon history, it was
not unusual for servants to be scourged to death by or by order of their
mistresses. Some of the collections of local miracles, such as those of
St. Swithun, at Winchester (of the tenth century), furnish us with horrible
pictures of the cruel treatment to which female slaves especially were
subjected. For comparatively slight offences they were loaded with gyves
and fetters, and subjected to all kinds of tortures. Several of these are
curiously illustrative of domestic manners. On one occasion, the maid-servant
of Teothic the bell-maker (<i>campanarius</i>), of Winchester, was, for
‚Äúa slight offence,‚Äù placed in iron fetters, and chained up by the feet and
hands all night. Next morning she was taken out to be frightfully
beaten, and she was put again into her bonds; but in the ensuing night
she contrived to make her escape, and fled to the church to seek
sanctuary at the tomb of St. Swithun, for being in a state of servitude
there was no legal protection for her. On another occasion, a female
servant had been stolen from a former master, and had passed into the
possession of another master in Winchester. One day her former master
came to Winchester, and the girl, hearing of it, went to speak to him.
When her mistress heard that she had been seen to talk with a man from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
a distant province, she ordered her to be thrown into fetters, and treated
very cruelly. Next day, while the mistress had gone out on some business,
leaving her servant at home in fetters, the latter made her escape
similarly to the sanctuary of the church. Another servant-girl in Winchester,
taking her master‚Äôs clothes to wash in the river, was set upon by
thieves, who robbed her of them. Her master, ascribing the mishap to
her own negligence, beat her very severely, and then put her in fetters,
from which she made her escape like the others. The interesting scene
represented in our cut, <a href="#n37">No. 37</a>, taken from the Harleian MS., No. 603,
fol. 14, v<sup>o</sup>., may be regarded as showing us the scourging of a slave. In
a picture in Alfric‚Äôs version of Genesis, the man scourged, instead of
being tied by the feet, is fixed by the body in a cloven post, in a rather
singular manner. The aptness with which the Saxon ladies made use of
the scourge is illustrated by one of William of Malmesbury‚Äôs anecdotes,
who tells us that, when king Ethelred was a child, he once so irritated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
his mother, that not having a whip, she beat him with some candles,
which were the first thing that fell under her hand, until he was almost
insensible. ‚ÄúOn this account he dreaded candles during the rest of his
life, to such a degree that he would never suffer the light of them to be
introduced in his presence!‚Äù</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 38. Hanging.</i></p></div>

<p>The cruelty of the Anglo-Saxon ladies to their servants offers a contrast
to the generally mild character of the punishments inflicted by
the Anglo-Saxon laws. The laws of Ethelred contain the following
injunction, showing how contrary capital punishment is to the spirit of
Anglo-Saxon legislation:&mdash;‚ÄúAnd the ordinance of our lord, and of his
witan (parliament), is, that Christian men for
all too little be not condemned to death; but
in general let mild punishment be decreed,
for the people‚Äôs need; and let not for a little
God‚Äôs handywork and his own purchase be
destroyed, which he dearly bought.‚Äù This
injunction is repeated in the laws of Canute.
It appears that the usual method of inflicting
death upon criminals was by hanging. Our
cut, <a href="#n38">No. 38</a>, taken from the illuminations
to Alfric‚Äôs version of Genesis, represents an
Anglo-Saxon gallows (<i>galga</i>), and the rather
primitive method of carrying the last penalty
of the law into effect. The early illuminated
manuscripts give us few representations of
popular punishments. The Anglo-Saxon
vocabularies enumerate the following implements of punishment, besides
the <i>galga</i>, or gallows: fetters (<i>f√¶ter</i>, <i>cops</i>), distinguished into foot-fetters
and hand-fetters; shackles (<i>scacul</i>, or <i>sceacul</i>), which appear to have
been used specially for the neck; a <i>swipa</i>, or scourge; <i>ostig gyrd</i>, a
knotted rod; <i>tindig</i>, explained by the Latin <i>scorpio</i>, and meaning
apparently a whip with knots or plummets at the end of thongs, like
those used by the charioteers in the cuts in our next chapter; and an
instrument of torture called a <i>threpel</i>, which is explained by the Latin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
<i>equuleus</i>. The following cut, <a href="#n39">No. 39</a>, from the Harleian MS., No. 603 (so
often quoted), shows us the stocks, generally placed by the side of the public
road at the entrance to the town. Two other offenders are attached to
the columns of the public building,
perhaps a court-house, by apparently
a rope and a chain. The Anglo-Saxon
laws prescribe few corporal
punishments, but substitute for them
the payment of fines, or compensation-money,
and these are proportioned
to the offences with very
extraordinary minuteness. Thus, to
select a few examples from the very
numerous list of injuries which may be done to a man‚Äôs person,&mdash;if any
one struck off an ear, he was to pay twelve shillings, and, if an eye, fifty
shillings; if the nose were cut through, the payment was nine shillings.
‚ÄúFor each of the four front teeth, six shillings; for the tooth which
stands next to them, four shillings; for that which follows, three shillings;
and for all the others, a shilling each.‚Äù If a thumb were struck off, it was
valued at twenty shillings. ‚ÄúIf the shooting finger were struck off‚Äù
(a term which shows how incorrectly it has been assumed that the Anglo-Saxons
were not accustomed to the bow), the compensation was eight
shillings; for the middle finger, four shillings; for the ring-finger, six
shillings; and for the little finger eleven shillings. The thumb-nail was
valued at three shillings; and the finger-nails at one shilling each.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 39. Anglo-Saxon Punishments.</i></p></div>

<p>We have little information on the secrets of the toilette of the Anglo-Saxons.
We know from many sources that washing and bathing were
frequent practices among them. The use of hot baths they probably
derived from the Romans. The vocabularies give <i>therm√¶</i> as the Latin
equivalent. They are not unfrequently mentioned in the ecclesiastical
laws, and in the canons passed in the reign of king Edgar, warm baths
and soft beds are proscribed as domestic luxuries which tended to
effeminacy. If these were really the <i>therm√¶</i> of the Romans, it is
perhaps the hostility of the ascetic part of the Romish clergy which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
caused them to be discontinued and forgotten. Our cut <a href="#n37">No. 37</a> represents
a party at their ablutions. We constantly find among the articles
in the graves of Anglo-Saxon ladies tweezers, which were evidently
intended for eradicating superfluous hairs, a circumstance which contributes
to show that they paid special attention to hair-dressing. To
judge from the colour of the hair in some of the illuminations, we might
be led to suppose that sometimes they stained it. The young men seem
to have been more foppish and vain of their persons than the ladies, and
some of the old chronicles, such as the Ely history, tell us (which we
should hardly have expected) that this was especially a characteristic of
the Danish invaders, who, we are told, ‚Äúfollowing the custom of their
country, used to comb their hair every day, bathed every Saturday, often
changed their clothes, and used many other such frivolous means of
setting off the beauty of their persons.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>There is every reason for believing that the Anglo-Saxon ladies were
fond of gardens and flowers, and many allusions in the writings of that
period intimate a warm appreciation of the beauties of nature. The
poets not unfrequently take their comparisons from flowers. Thus, in a
poem in the Exeter Book, a pleasant smell is described as being&mdash;

<p>Before we quit entirely the Saxon hall, and its festivities and ceremonies,
we must mention one circumstance connected with them. The
laws and customs of the Anglo-Saxons earnestly enjoined the duty of
almsgiving, and a multitude of persons partook of the hospitality of the
rich man‚Äôs mansion, who were not worthy to be admitted to his tables.
These assembled at meal-times outside the gate of his house, and it was
a custom to lay aside a portion of the provisions to be distributed among
them, with the fragments from the table. In Alfric‚Äôs homily for the
second Sunday after Pentecost, the preacher, after dwelling on the story
of Lazarus, who was spurned from the rich man‚Äôs table, appeals to his
Anglo-Saxon audience&mdash;‚Äúmany Lazaruses ye have now lying at your
gates, begging for your superfluity.‚Äù Bede tells us of the good king
Oswald, that when he was once sitting at dinner, on Easter-day, with his
bishop, having a silver dish full of dainties before him, as they were just
ready to bless the bread, the servant whose duty it was to relieve the
poor, came in on a sudden and told the king that a great multitude of
needy persons from all parts were sitting in the streets begging some alms
of the king. The latter immediately ordered the provisions set before
him to be carried to the poor, and the dish to be cut in pieces and
divided among them. In the picture of a Saxon house given in our first
chapter (p. 15), we see the lord of the household on a sort of throne at the
entrance to his hall, presiding over the distribution of his charity. This
seat, generally under an arch or canopy, is often represented in the Saxon
manuscripts, and the chief or lord seated under it, distributing justice or
charity. In the accompanying cut, <a href="#n40">No. 40</a>, taken from the Anglo-Saxon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
manuscript of Prudentius, the lady Wisdom is represented seated on such
a throne. It was, perhaps, the <i>burh-geat-setl</i>, or seat at the burh-gate,
mentioned as characteristic of the rank of the thane in the following
extract from a treatise on ranks in society, printed with the Anglo-Saxon
laws: ‚ÄúAnd if a ceorl thrived, so that he had fully five hides of his own
land, church (or perhaps private chapel), and kitchen (<i>kycenan</i>), bell-house,
and burh-gate-seat, and special duty in the king‚Äôs hall, then was
he thenceforth worthy of the dignity of thane.‚Äù</p>

<span class="small table">OUT OF DOOR AMUSEMENTS OF THE ANGLO-SAXONS.&mdash;HUNTING AND
HAWKING.&mdash;HORSES AND CARRIAGES.&mdash;TRAVELLING.&mdash;MONEY-DEALINGS.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> progress of society from its first formation to the full development
of civilization, has been compared not inaptly to the life of
man. In the childhood and youth of society, when the population was
not numerous, and a servile class performed the chief part of the labour
necessary for administering to the wants or luxuries of life, people had a
far greater proportion of time on their hands to fill up with amusements
than at a later period, and many that are now considered frivolous, or are
only indulged in at rare intervals of relaxation, then formed the principal
occupations of men‚Äôs lives. We have glanced at the in-door amusements
of the Anglo-Saxons in a previous chapter; but their out-door recreations,
although we have little information respecting them, were certainly much
more numerous. The multitude of followers who, in Saxon times,
attended on each lord or rich man as their military chief, or as their
domestic supporter, had generally no serious occupation during the greater
part of the day; and this abundance of unemployed time was not confined
to one class of society, for the artisan had to work less to gain his
subsistence, and both citizen and peasant were excused from work altogether
during the numerous holidays of the year.</p>

<p>That the Anglo-Saxons were universally fond of play (<i>plega</i>) is proved
by the frequent use of the word in a metaphorical sense. They even
applied it to fighting and battle, which, in the language of the poets,
were <i>plega-gares</i> (play of darts), <i>√¶sc-plega</i> (play of shields), and <i>hand-plega</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
(play of hands).<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> In the glossaries, <i>plegere</i> (a player), and <i>plega-man</i>
(a playman), are used to represent the Roman <i>gladiator</i>; and
<i>plega-h√∫s</i> (a playhouse), and <i>plega-stow</i> (a play-place), express a theatre,
or more probably an amphitheatre. Recent discoveries have shown that
there was a theatre of considerable dimensions in the Roman town of
Verulamium (near St. Alban‚Äôs); and old writers tell us there was one at
the Silurian Isca (Caerleon), though these buildings were doubtless of
rare occurrence; but every Roman town of any importance in the island
had its amphitheatre outside the walls for gladiatorial and other exhibitions.
The result of modern researches seems to prove that most of the
Roman towns continued to exist after the Saxon settlement of the island,
and we can have no doubt that the amphitheatres, at least for awhile,
continued to be devoted to their original purposes, although the performances
were modified in character. Some of them (like that at Richborough,
in Kent, lately examined), were certainly surrounded by walls,
while others probably were merely cut in the ground, and surrounded by
a low embankment formed of the material thrown out. The first of
these, the Saxons would naturally call a play-house, while the other
would receive the no less appropriate appellation of a play-stow, or place
for playing. Among the illustrations of the Anglo-Saxon manuscript of
the Psalms (MS. Harl., No. 603), to which we have so often had occasion
to refer, there is a very curious picture, evidently intended to represent
an amphitheatre outside a town. It is copied in our cut <a href="#n41">No. 41</a>.
The rude Anglo-Saxon draughtsman has evidently intended to represent
an embankment, occupied by the spectators, around the spot where the
performances take place. The spectator to the left is expressing his
approbation by clapping with his hands. The performances themselves
are singular: we have a party of minstrels, one of them playing on the
Roman double pipes, so often represented in Anglo-Saxon manuscripts,
while another is dancing to him, and the third is performing with a tame
bear, which is at the moment of the representation simulating sleep.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
Games of this kind with animals, succeeded no doubt among the Saxons
to the Roman gladiatorial fights, but few have imagined that the popular
English exhibition of the dancing bear dated from so remote a period.
The manuscripts show that the double pipe was in use among the Anglo-Saxons;
with a little modification, and a bag or bellows to supply the
place of the human lungs, this instrument was transformed into a bagpipe.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n41" src="images/i_n41.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 41. Games of the Amphitheatre.</i></p></div>

<p>Not the least curious part of this picture is the town in the background,
with its entrance gateway, and public buildings. The Anglo-Saxon
draughtsmen were imperfectly acquainted with perspective, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
paid little attention to proportion in their representations of towns and
houses, a circumstance which is fully illustrated in this picture. As the
artist was unable from this circumstance to represent the buildings and
streets of a town in their relative position, he put in a house to represent
a multitude of houses, and here he has similarly given one building within
the walls to represent all the public buildings of the town. An exactly
similar characteristic will be observed in our cut <a href="#n42">No. 42</a>, taken from the
same manuscript, where one temple represents the town. Here again
we have a party of citizens outside the walls, amusing themselves as well
as they can; some, for want of other employment, are laying themselves
down listlessly on the ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n42" src="images/i_n42.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 42. A Town.</i></p></div>

<p>The national sentiments and customs of the Anglo-Saxons would,
however, lead to the selection of other places for the scenes of their
games, and thus the Roman amphitheatres became neglected. Each
village had its arena&mdash;its play-place&mdash;where persons of all ages and sexes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
assembled on their holidays to be players or lookers on; and this appears
to have been usually chosen near a fountain, or some object hallowed by
the popular creed, for customs of this kind were generally associated with
religious feelings which tended to consecrate and protect them. These
holiday games, which appear to have been very common among our
Saxon forefathers, were the originals of our village wakes. Wandering
minstrels, like those represented in our cut <a href="#n41">No. 41</a>, repaired to them to
exhibit their skill, and were always welcome. The young men exerted
themselves in running, or leaping, or wrestling. These games attracted
merchants, and gradually became the centres of extensive fairs. Such
was the case with one of the most celebrated in England during the
middle ages, that of Barnwell, near Cambridge. It was a large open place,
between the town and the banks of the river, well suited for such festivities
as those of which we are speaking. A spring in the middle of this
plain, we are told in the early chartulary of Barnwell Abbey, was called
Beornawyl (the well of the youths), because every year, on the eve of
the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, the boys and youths of the neighbourhood
assembled there, and, ‚Äúafter the manners of the English, practised
wrestling and other boyish games, and mutually applauded one
another with songs and musical instruments; whence, on account of the
multitude of boys and girls who gathered together there, it grew a custom
for a crowd of sellers and buyers to assemble there on the same day for
the purpose of commerce.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> This is a curious and a rather rare allusion
to an Anglo-Saxon wake.</p>

<p>One of the great recreations of the Anglo-Saxons was hunting, for
which the immense forests, which then covered a great portion of this
island, gave a wide scope. The most austere and pious, as well as the
most warlike, of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs, were passionately attached
to the pleasures of the chase. According to the writer who has assumed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
the name of Asser, the great Alfred was so attached to this amusement,
that he condescended to teach his ‚Äúfalconers, hawkers, and dog-keepers‚Äù
himself. His grandson, king Ethelstan, as we learn from William of
Malmesbury, exacted from the Welsh princes, among other articles of
tribute, ‚Äúas many dogs as he might choose, which, from their sagacious
scent, could discover the retreats and hiding-places of wild beasts; and
birds trained to make prey of others in the air.‚Äù The same writer tells
us of the sainted Edward the Confessor, that ‚Äúthere was one earthly
enjoyment in which he chiefly delighted, which was, hunting with fleet
hounds, whose opening in the woods he used with pleasure to encourage;
and again, with the pouncing of birds, whose nature it is to prey on their
kindred species. In these exercises, after hearing divine service in the
morning, he employed himself whole days.‚Äù It is evident from the
ecclesiastical laws, that it was difficult to restrain even the clergy from
this diversion. One of the ecclesiastical canons passed in the reign of
king Edgar, enjoins ‚Äúthat no priest be a hunter, or fowler, or player at
tables, but let him play on his books, as becometh his calling.‚Äù When
the king hunted, it appears that men were employed to beat up the
game, while others were placed at different avenues of the forest to
hinder the deer from taking a direction contrary to the wishes of the
hunter. Several provisions relating to the employment of men in this
way, occur in the Domesday survey. A contemporary writer of the Life
of Dunstan gives the following description of the hunting of king Edmund
the Elder, at Ceoddri (Chedder). ‚ÄúWhen they reached the forest,‚Äù he
says, ‚Äúthey took various directions along the woody avenues, and the
varied noise of the horns, and the barking of the dogs, aroused many
stags. From these, the king with his pack of hounds chose one for his
own hunting, and pursued it long, through devious ways with great
agility on his horse, with the hounds following. In the vicinity of
Ceoddri were several steep and lofty precipices hanging over deep declivities.
To one of these the stag came in his flight, and dashed headlong
to his destruction down the immense depth, all the dogs following and
perishing with him.‚Äù The king with difficulty held in his horse.</p>

<div class="figright"><img id="n43" src="images/i_n43.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 43. Anglo-Saxon Dogs.</i></p></div>

<p>The dogs (<i>hundas</i>), used for the chase among the Anglo-Saxons, were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
valuable, and were bred with great care. Every noble or great landowner
had his <i>hund-wealh</i>, or dog-keeper. The accompanying cut
(<a href="#n43">No. 43</a>), taken from the Harleian MS. No. 603, represents a dog-keeper,
with his couple of hounds&mdash;they
seem to have hunted in couples. The
Anglo-Saxon name for a hunting-dog
was <i>ren-hund</i>, a dog of chase, which
is interpreted by greyhound; and this
appears, from the cut, to have been
the favourite dog of our Saxon forefathers.
It appears by an allusion
given above, that the Saxons obtained
hunting dogs from Wales; yet the
antiquary will be at once struck with
the total dissimilarity of the dogs pictured in the Anglo-Saxon manuscripts,
from the British dogs represented on the Romano-British pottery.
The dogs were used to find the game, and follow it by the scent; the
hunters killed it with spears, or with bows and arrows, or drove it into
nets. In the Colloquy of Alfric, a hunter (<i>hunta</i>) of one of the royal
forests gives a curious account of his profession. When asked how he
practises his ‚Äúcraft,‚Äù he replies, ‚ÄúI braid nets, and set them in a convenient
place, and set on my hounds, that they may pursue the beasts of
chase, until they come unexpectedly to the nets, and so become intangled
in them, and I slay them in the nets.‚Äù He is then asked if he cannot
hunt without nets, to which he replies, ‚ÄúYes, I pursue the wild animals
with swift hounds.‚Äù He next enumerates the different kinds of game
which the Saxon hunter usually hunted&mdash;‚ÄúI take harts, and boars, and
deer, and roes, and sometimes hares.‚Äù ‚ÄúYesterday,‚Äù he continues,
‚ÄúI took two harts and a boar, ... the harts with nets, and I slew the
boar with my weapon.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow were you so hardy as to slay a boar?‚Äù
‚ÄúMy hounds drove him to me, and I, there facing him, suddenly struck
him down.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou were very bold then.‚Äù ‚ÄúA hunter must not be
timid, for various wild beasts dwell in the woods.‚Äù It would seem by
this, that boar-hunting was not uncommon in the more extensive forests
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
of this island; but Sharon Turner has made a singular mistake, in supposing,
from a picture in the Anglo-Saxon calendar, that boar-hunting
was the ordinary occupation of the month of September. The scene
which he has thus mistaken&mdash;or at least, a portion of it&mdash;is given in our
cut <a href="#n44">No. 44</a> (from the Cottonian MS. Claudius, C. viii.); it represents
swineherds driving their swine into the forests to feed upon acorns, which
one of the herdsmen is shaking from the trees with his hand. The
herdsmen were necessarily armed to protect the herds under their charge
from robbers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n44" src="images/i_n44.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 44. Swine-Herds.</i></p></div>

<p>The Anglo-Saxons, as we have seen, were no less attached to hawking
than hunting. The same Colloquy already quoted contains the following
dialogue relating to the fowler (<i>fugelere</i>). To the question, ‚ÄúHow dost
thou catch birds?‚Äù he replies, ‚ÄúI catch them in many ways; sometimes
with nets, sometimes with snares, sometimes with bird-lime, sometimes
with whistling, sometimes with a hawk, sometimes with a trap.‚Äù ‚ÄúHast
thou a hawk?‚Äù ‚ÄúI have.‚Äù ‚ÄúCanst thou tame them?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, I can;
of what use would they be to me unless I could tame them?‚Äù ‚ÄúGive
me a hawk.‚Äù ‚ÄúI will give one willingly in exchange for a swift hound.
What kind of hawk will you have, the greater or the lesser?‚Äù...
‚ÄúHow feedest thou thy hawks?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey feed themselves and me in
winter, and in spring I let them fly to the wood, and I catch young ones
in autumn and tame them.‚Äù A party of hawkers is represented in our
cut <a href="#n45">No. 45</a>, taken from the manuscript last quoted, where it illustrates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
the month of October. The rude attempt at depicting a landscape is
intended to represent a river running from the distant hills into a lake,
and the hawkers are hunting cranes and other water-fowl. Presents of
hawks and falcons are not unfrequently mentioned in Anglo-Saxon
writers; and in a will, an Anglo-Saxon leaves to his natural lord ‚Äútwo
hawks and all his stag-hounds.‚Äù</p>

<p>The Saxon youths were proud of their skill in horsemanship. Bede
relates an anecdote of the youthful days of Herebald, abbot of Tynemouth,
when he attended upon bishop
John of Beverley, from Herebald‚Äôs
own words&mdash;‚ÄúIt happened one day,‚Äù
the latter said, ‚Äúthat as we were
travelling with him (the bishop), we
came into a plain and open road, well
adapted for galloping our horses. The
young men that were with him, and
particularly those of the laity, began
to entreat the bishop to give them
leave to gallop, and make trial of the
goodness of their horses.... When
they had several times galloped backwards
and forwards, the bishop and I
looking on, my wanton humour prevailed, and I could no longer refrain;
but, though he forbade me, I struck in among them, and began to ride
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
at full speed.‚Äù Horses were used chiefly by the upper classes of society
in travelling. Two of a party of Saxon travellers are represented in our
cut <a href="#n46">No. 46</a> (from MS. Cotton. Claudius, B. iv.). The lady, it will be
observed, rides sideways, as in
modern times, and the illuminated
manuscripts of different
periods furnish us with examples
enough to show that such was
always the practice; yet an old
writer has ascribed the introduction
of side-saddles into this
country to Anne of Bohemia,
the queen of Richard II., and
the statement has been repeated
by writers on costume, who too often blindly compile from one another
without examining carefully the original sources of information.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> The
next cut, <a href="#n47">No. 47</a> (taken from
MS. Harl. No. 603), represents
a horseman with his arms, the
spear, and the round shield, with
its boss, which reminds us of
those frequently found in the
early Anglo-Saxon graves. The
horse furniture is tolerably well
defined in these figures. The
forms of the spur (<i>spura</i>) and
the stirrup (called in Anglo-Saxon
<i>stirap</i> and <i>hlypa</i>) are very peculiar. Most of the furniture of the
horse was then, as now, of leather, and was made by the shoemaker
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
(<i>se sceowyrhta</i>), who seems to have been the general manufacturer of
articles in this material. Alfric‚Äôs Colloquy enumerates among the articles
made by the shoemaker, bridle-thongs (<i>bridel-thwancgas</i>), harnesses
(<i>ger≈ìda</i>), spur-leathers (<i>spur-lethera</i>), and halters (<i>h√¶lfra</i>). The form
of the saddle is shown in the representation of a horse without a rider,
given, from the manuscript last quoted, in our cut <a href="#n48">No. 48</a>.</p>

<p>In the Anglo-Saxon church histories, we meet with frequent instances
of persons, who were unable to walk from sickness or other cause, being
carried in carts or cars, but in most cases these seem to have been nothing
but the common agricultural carts adapted temporarily to this usage. A
horse-litter is on one occasion used for the same purpose. It is certain,
however, that the Anglo-Saxons had chariots for travelling. The usual
names of all vehicles of this kind were <i>w√¶gn</i> or <i>w√¶n</i> (from which, our
<i>waggon</i>) and <i>crat</i> or <i>cr√¶t</i> (which appears to be the origin of the English
word <i>cart</i>). These two terms appear to have been used synonymously,
for the words of the 18th Psalm, <i>hi in curribus</i>, are translated in one
Anglo-Saxon version by <i>on w√¶num</i>, and in another by <i>in cr√¶tum</i>. The
Anglo-Saxon manuscripts give us various representations of vehicles for
travelling. The one represented in the cut <a href="#n49">No. 49</a> is taken from the
Anglo-Saxon manuscript of Prudentius. It seems to have been a barbaric
‚Äúimprovement‚Äù upon the Roman <i>biga</i>, and is not much unlike our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
modern market-carts. The whip used by the lady who is driving so
furiously, is of the same form as that used by the horsewoman in our cut
No. 46. The artist has not shown the <i>w√¶gne-thixl</i>, or shaft. A four-wheeled
carriage, of rather a singular construction, is found often repeated,
with some variations, in the illuminations of the manuscript of Alfric‚Äôs
translation of the Pentateuch. One of them is given in our cut <a href="#n50">No. 50</a>.
It is quite evident that a good deal
of the minor detail of construction
has been omitted by the draughtsman.
Anglo-Saxon glosses give the
word <i>rad</i> to represent the Latin
<i>quadriga</i>. From the same source
we learn that the compound word
<i>w√¶n-f√¶r</i>, waggon-going, was used
to express journeying in chariots.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img id="n50" src="images/i_n50.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 50. An Anglo-Saxon Carriage.</i></p></div>

<p>Riding in chariots must have
been rare among the Anglo-Saxons.
Horses were only used by the better
classes of society; and we learn from Bede and other writers that pious
ecclesiastics, such as bishops Aidan, Ceadda, and Cuthbert, thought it
more consistent with the humility of their sacred character to journey on
foot. The pedestrian carried either a spear or a staff; the rider had
almost always a spear. It is noted of Cuthbert, in Bede‚Äôs life of that
saint, that one day when he came to Mailros (Melrose), and would enter
the church to pray, having leaped from his horse, he ‚Äúgave the latter
and his travelling spear to the care of a servant, for he had not yet
resigned the dress and habits of a layman.‚Äù The weapon was, no doubt,
necessary for personal safety. There is a very curious clause in the
Anglo-Saxon laws of king Alfred, relating to an accident arising from
the carrying the spear, which we can hardly understand, although to
require a special law it must have been of frequent occurrence; this law
provides that ‚Äúif a man have a spear over his shoulder, and <i>any man
stake himself upon it</i>,‚Äù the carrier of the spear incurred severe punishment,
‚Äúif the point be three fingers higher than the hindmost part of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
the shaft.‚Äù He was not considered blameable if he held the spear quite
horizontally.</p>

<p>The traveller always wore a covering for his head, which, though of
various shapes, none of which resembled our modern hat, was characterised
by the general term of <i>h√¶t</i>. He seems to have been further protected
against the inclemency of the weather by a cloak or mantle (<i>mentel</i>).
One would be led to suppose that this outer garment was more varied in
form and material than any other part of the dress, from the great
number of names which we find applied to it, such as <i>basing</i>, <i>h√¶cce</i>,
<i>h√¶cela</i>, or <i>hacela</i>, <i>p√¶ll</i>, <i>pylca</i>, <i>scyccels</i>, <i>w√¶fels</i>, &amp;c. The writings which
remain throw no light upon the provisions made by travellers against
rain; for the dictionary-makers who give <i>sc√∫r-scead</i> (shower-shade) as
signifying an umbrella, are certainly mistaken.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> Yet that umbrellas
were known to the Anglo-Saxons is proved beyond a doubt by a figure
in the Harleian manuscript, No. 603, which is given in our cut <a href="#n51">No. 51</a>.
A servant or attendant is holding an umbrella over
the head of a man who appears to be covered at
the same time with the cloak or mantle.</p>

<p>Travelling to any distance must have been rendered
more uncomfortable, especially when passing
through wild districts where there were no inns.
The word <i>inn</i> is itself Saxon, and signified a lodging,
but it appears to have been more usually applied to
houses of this kind in towns. A tavern was also
called a <i>gest-hus</i> or <i>gest-bur</i>, a house or chamber
for guests, and <i>cumena-hus</i>, a house of comers.
Guest-houses, like caravanserais in the East, appear to have been established
in different parts of Saxon England, near the high roads, for the reception
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
of travellers. A traveller in Bede arrives at a <i>hospitium</i> in the north
of England, which was kept by a <i>paterfamilias</i> (or father of a family)
and his household. In the Northumbrian gloss on the Psalms, printed
by the Surtees Society, the Latin words of Psalm liv., <i>in hospitiis eorum</i>,
are rendered by <i>in gest-husum heara</i>. This shows that Bede‚Äôs <i>hospitium</i>
was really a guest-house: these guest-houses were kept up in various
parts of England until Norman times; and Walter Mapes, in his treatise
de Nugis Curialium, has preserved a story relating to one of William the
Conqueror‚Äôs Saxon opponents, Edric the Wild, which tells how, returning
from hunting in the forest of Dean, and accompanied only with a page,
he came to a large house, ‚Äúlike the drinking houses of which the English
have one in every parish, called in English gild-houses,‚Äù perhaps an error
for guest-houses (<i>quales Anglici in singulis singulas habebant diocesibus
bibitorias, ghildhus Anglice dictas</i>). It seems not improbable, also, that
the ruins of Roman villas and small stations, which stood by the sides
of roads, were often roughly repaired or modified, so as to furnish a
temporary shelter for travellers who carried provisions, &amp;c., with them,
and could therefore lodge themselves without depending upon the assistance
of others. A shelter of this kind&mdash;from its consisting of bare walls,
a mere shelter against the inclemency of the storm&mdash;might be termed a
<i>ceald-hereberga</i> (cold harbour), and this would account for the great
number of places in different parts of England, which bear this name,
and which are almost always on Roman sites and near old roads. The
explanation is supported by the circumstance that the name is found
among the Teutonic nations on the continent&mdash;the German <i>Kalten-herberg</i>&mdash;borne
by some inns at the present day.</p>

<p>The deficiency of such comforts for travellers in Anglo-Saxon times
was compensated by the extensive practice of hospitality, a virtue which
was effectually inculcated by the customs of the people as well as by the
civil and ecclesiastical laws. When a stranger presented himself at a
Saxon door, and asked for board and lodging, the man who refused them
was looked upon with contempt by his countrymen. In the seventh
century, as we learn from the P≈ìnitentiale of archbishop Theodore, the
refusal to give lodging to a stranger (<i>quicunque hospitem non receperit in</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
<i>domum suam</i>) was considered worthy of ecclesiastical censure. And in the
Ecclesiastical Institutes, drawn up at a later period, and printed in the
collection of Anglo-Saxon laws, it is stated that ‚ÄúIt is also very needful
to every mass-priest, that he diligently exhort and teach his parishioners
that they be hospitable, and not refuse their houses to any wayfaring
man, but do for his comfort, for love of God, what they then will or
can; ... but let those who, for love of God, receive every stranger,
desire not any worldly reward.‚Äù Bede describes as the first act of ‚Äúthe
custom of hospitality‚Äù (<i>mos hospitalitatis</i>) the washing of the stranger‚Äôs
feet and hands; they then offered him refreshment, and he was allowed
to remain two nights without being questioned, after which period the
host became answerable for his character. The ecclesiastical laws limited
the hospitality to be shown to a priest to one night, because if he remained
longer it was a proof that he was neglecting his duties.</p>

<p>Taverns of an ordinary description, where there was probably no
accommodation for travellers, seem to have been common enough under
the Anglo-Saxons and it must be confessed that there seems to be too
much reason for believing that people spent a great deal of their leisure
time in them; even the clergy appear to have been tempted to frequent
them. In the Ecclesiastical Institutes, quoted above, mass-priests are
forbidden to eat or drink at ale-houses (<i>√¶t ceap-ealothelum</i>). And it is
stated in the same curious record that, ‚ÄúIt is a very bad custom that many
men practise, both on Sundays and also other mass-days; that is, that
straightways at early morn they desire to hear mass, and immediately
after the mass, from early morn the whole day over, in drunkenness and
feasting they minister to their belly, not to God.‚Äù</p>

<p>Merchant travellers seem, in general, to have congregated together
in parties or small caravans, both for companionship and as a measure of
mutual defence against robbers. In such cases they probably carried tents
with them, and formed little encampments at night, like the pedlars and
itinerant dealers in later times. Men who travelled alone were exposed
to other dangers besides that of robbery; for a solitary wanderer was
always looked upon with suspicion, and he was in danger himself of being
taken for a thief. He was compelled, therefore, by his own interest and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
by the law of the land, to show that he had no wish to avoid observation;
one of the earlier Anglo-Saxon codes of laws, that of king Wihtr√¶d,
directed that ‚Äúif a man come from afar, or a stranger go out of the high
way, and he then neither shout nor blow a horn, he is to be accounted a
thief, either to be slain, or to be redeemed.‚Äù</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n52" src="images/i_n52.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 52. Taking Toll.</i></p></div>

<p>So prevalent, indeed, was theft and unfair dealing among our Anglo-Saxon
forefathers, and so much litigation and unjust persecution arose
from disputed claims to property which had been, or was pretended to
have been, purchased, that it was made illegal to buy or sell without
witnesses. It would be easy to multiply examples of robbery and plunder
from Anglo-Saxon writers; but I will only state that, according to the
Ely history, some merchants from Ireland, having come to Cambridge in
the time of king Edgar, to offer their wares for sale, perhaps at the
annual festivities of the Beorna-wyl, mentioned above, a <i>priest</i> of the
place was guilty of stealing a part of their merchandise. We know but
little of the trades and forms of commercial dealings of the Anglo-Saxons;
but we may take our leave of the period of which we have been hitherto
treating, with a few figures relating to money matters, from the Anglo-Saxon
manuscript of the Psalms (MS. Harl. No. 603). The cut <a href="#n52">No. 52</a>
represents, apparently, a man in the market, or at the gates of a city,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
taking toll for merchandise. The scales are for weighing, not the merchandise,
but the money. The word <i>pund</i>, or pound, implies that the
money was reckoned by weight; and the word <i>mancus</i>, another term for
a certain sum of money, is also considered to have been a weight. Anglo-Saxon
writings frequently speak of money as given by weight. Our cut
No. 53 is a representation of the merchant, or the toll-taker, seated
before his account book, with his scales hanging to the desk. In the first
of these cuts, a man holds the bag or purse, in which the money received
for toll or merchandise is deposited. The cut <a href="#n54">No. 54</a> represents the
receiver pouring the money out of his bag into the <i>cyst</i>, or chest, in which
it is to be locked up and kept in his treasury. It is hardly necessary to
say that there were no banking-houses among the Anglo-Saxons. The
chest, or coffer, in which people kept their money and other valuables,
appears to have formed part of the furniture of the chamber, as being
the most private apartment; and it may be remarked that a rich man‚Äôs
wealth usually consisted much more in jewels and valuable plate than in
money.</p>

<p>We cannot but remark how little change the manners and the sentiments
of our Saxon forefathers underwent during the long period that we
are in any way acquainted with them. During the reign of Edward the
Confessor, Norman fashions were introduced at court, but their influence
on the nation at large appears to have been very trifling. Even after the
Norman conquest the English manners and fashions retained their hold
on the people, and at later periods they continually re-appear to assert
their natural rights among the descendants of the Anglo-Saxons.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">A great</span> change was wrought in this country by the entrance of
the Normans. From what we have seen, in the course of the
preceding chapters, society seems for a long time to have been at a standstill
among the Anglo-Saxons, as though it had progressed as far as its
own simple vitality would carry it, and wanted some new impulse to
move it onwards. By the entrance of the Normans, the Saxon aristocracy
was destroyed; but the lower and, in a great measure, the middle classes
were left untouched in their manners and customs, which they appear to
have preserved for a considerable length of time without any material
change. The Norman historians, who write with prejudice when they
speak of the Saxons, describe their nobility as having become luxurious
without refinement; and they tell us that the Normans introduced
greater sobriety, accompanied with more ostentation. ‚ÄúThe nobility,‚Äù
says William of Malmesbury, ‚Äúwas given up to luxury and wantonness....
Drinking in parties was an universal practice, in which occupation
they passed entire nights as well as days. They consumed their whole
substance in mean and despicable houses; unlike the Normans and
French, who, in noble and splendid mansions, lived with frugality. The
vices attendant on drunkenness, which enervate the human mind, followed....
In fine, the English at that time (under king Harold) wore
short garments, reaching to the mid-knee; they had their hair cropped,
their beards shaven, their arms laden with golden bracelets, their skin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
adorned with punctured designs; they were accustomed to eat till they
became surfeited, and to drink till they were sick. These latter qualities
they imparted to their conquerors; whose manners, in other respects,
they adopted.‚Äù</p>

<p>Whatever moderation the Normans may have brought with them, or
however they may have been restrained by the first Anglo-Norman
monarch, it disappeared entirely under his son and successor: ‚Äúwhen,‚Äù in
the words of William of Malmesbury, ‚Äúeverything was so changed, that
there was no man rich except the money-changer, and no clerks but
lawyers.... The courtiers then preyed upon the property of the country
people, and consumed their substance, taking the very meat from their
mouths. Then was there flowing hair and extravagant dress; and then
was invented the fashion of shoes with curved points; then the model
for young men was to rival women in delicacy of person, to mince their
gait, to walk with loose gesture, and half naked.‚Äù This increasing dissoluteness
of manners appears to have received no effectual check under
the reign of the first Henry; in the twenty-ninth year of which, the
writer just quoted tells us that ‚Äúa circumstance occurred in England,
which may seem surprising to our long-haired gallants, who, forgetting
what they were born, transform themselves into the fashion of females,
by the length of their locks. A certain English knight, who prided himself
on the luxuriance of his tresses, being conscience-stung on the subject,
seemed to feel in a dream as though some person strangled him with his
ringlets. Awaking in a fright, he immediately cut off all his superfluous
hair. The example spread throughout England; and, as recent punishment
is apt to affect the mind, almost all the barons allowed their hair to
be cropped in a proper manner, without reluctance. But this decency
was not of long continuance; for scarcely had a year expired, before all
those who thought themselves courtly, relapsed into their former vice;
they vied with women in length of locks, and wherever these were
wanting, put on false tresses; forgetful, or rather ignorant, of the saying
of the Apostle, ‚ÄòIf a man nurture his hair, it is a shame to him.‚Äô‚Äù Public
and private manners were gradually running into the terrible lawlessness
of the reign of king Stephen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>William of Malmesbury points out as one of the more remarkable
circumstances which distinguished the Normans from the Saxons, the
magnitude and solidity of their domestic buildings. The Anglo-Saxons
seem, indeed, to have preferred the old national prejudice of their race
against confining themselves within stone walls, while the Normans and
Franks, who were more influenced by Roman traditions, had become
great builders. We have scarcely any information relative to the progress
of domestic architecture under William the Conqueror, but the
Norman chiefs seem from the first to have built themselves houses of a
much more substantial character than those which they found in existence.
The residence of the Conqueror, while engaged in his operations against
the insurgents in the isle of Ely, is imperfectly described by the anonymous
author of the life of Hereward. It consisted of the hall, kitchen,
and other buildings, which were inclosed by hedges and fosses (<i>per sepes
et foveas</i>), and it had an interior and exterior court. Towards the end of
the Conqueror‚Äôs reign, and in that of his son, were raised those early
Norman baronial castles, the masonry of which has withstood the ravages
of so many centuries. Under William and his sons, few ordinary mansions
and dwelling houses seem to have been built substantially of stone;
I am not aware that there are any known remains of a stone mansion in
this country older than the reign of Henry II. The miracles of St. Cuthbert,
related by Reginald of Durham, contain one or two allusions to the
private houses of the earlier part of the twelfth century. Thus a
parishioner of Kellow, near Durham, in the time of bishop Walter Rufus
(1133-1140), is described as passing the evening drinking with the
parish priest; returning home late, he was pursued by dogs, and reaching
his own house in great terror, contrived to shut the door (<i>ostium domus</i>)
upon them. He then went up to what, from the context, appears to
have been the window of an upper floor or garret (<i>ad fenestram parietis</i>),
which he opened in order to look down with safety on his persecutors.
He was suddenly seized with madness, and his family being roused,
seized him, carried him down into the court (<i>in area</i>), and bound
him to the seats (<i>ad sedilia</i>). The same writer tells the story of a blind
woman in the city of Durham, who used to run her head against
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
the projecting windows of the houses (<i>ad fenestrarum dependentia foris
laquearia</i>).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n55" src="images/i_n55.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 55. A Norman Carousal.</i></p></div>

<p>We trace in the illuminations of the earlier Norman period the custom
of placing the principal apartment at an elevation from the ground.
The simple plan of the stone-built house of the latter part of this
century, consisted of a square room on the ground floor, often vaulted,
and of one room above it, which was the principal apartment, and the
sleeping-room. This was approached by a staircase, sometimes external
and sometimes internal, and it had a fire-place (<i>chemin√©e</i>), though this
was not always the case in the room below. The lower room was the
hall, and the upper apartment was called a <i>solar</i>, or <i>soller</i> (<i>solarium</i>), a
word which has been supposed to be derived from <i>sol</i>, the sun, which was
more felt in this upper room than in the lower, inasmuch as it was better
lighted&mdash;it was the sunny room. Yet, even here, the windows were
small, and without glass. We learn from Joscelin de Brakelonde that,
in the year 1182, Samson, abbot of Bury, while lodging in a grange, or
manor-house, belonging to his abbey, narrowly escaped being burnt with
the house, because the only door of the upper story in which he was
lodged happened to be locked, and the windows were too narrow to
admit of his passing through them. In the early English ‚ÄúAncren
Riewle,‚Äù or rule of nuns, published by the Camden Society, there are
several allusions to the windows of the parlour, or private room, which
show that they were not glazed, but usually covered with a cloth, or blind,
which allowed sufficient light to pass, and that they had shutters on hinges
which closed them entirely. In talking of the danger of indulging the
eyes, the writer of this treatise (p. 50) says, ‚ÄúMy dear sisters, love your
windows‚Äù&mdash;they are called in the original text <i>thurles</i>, holes through
the wall&mdash;‚Äúas little as you may, and let them be small, and the parlour‚Äôs
least and narrowest; let the cloth in them be twofould, black cloth, the
cross white within and without.‚Äù The writer goes on to moralise on the
white cross upon a black ground. In another part of the book (p. 97),
the author supposes that men may come and seek to converse with the
nuns through the window, and goes on to say, ‚ÄúIf any man become so
mad and unreasonable that he put forth his hand towards the windowcloth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
(<i>the thurl-cloth</i>), shut the window quickly and leave him.‚Äù Under
the hall, when it was raised above the level of the ground, there was
often another vaulted room, which was the cellar, and which seems to
have been usually entered from the inside of the building. In the
accompanying cut (<a href="#n55">No. 55</a>), taken from the celebrated tapestry of Bayeux,
are seen Harold and his companions carousing in an apartment thus
situated, and approached by a staircase from without. The object of this
was, perhaps, partly to be more private, for the ordinary public hall at
dinner times seems to have been invaded by troops of hungry hangers on,
who ate up or carried away the provisions which were taken from the
table, and became so bold that they seem to have often seized or tried to
seize the provisions from the cooks as they carried them to the table.
William Rufus established ushers of the hall and kitchen, whole duty it
was to protect the guests and the cooks from this rude rabble. Gaimar‚Äôs
description of that king‚Äôs grand feast at Westminster, contains some curious
allusions to this practice. After telling us that three hundred ushers
(<i>ussers</i>, i.e. <i>huissiers</i>), or doorkeepers, were appointed to occupy the
entrance passages (<i>us</i>), who were to hand with rods to protect the guests
as they mounted the steps from the importunity of the <i>garsons</i>&mdash;

<p>In the cut from the Bayeux tapestry, the feasting-room is approached
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
by what is evidently a staircase of stone. In our cut <a href="#n56">No. 56</a>, taken from
a manuscript of the earlier half of the twelfth century in the Cottonian
library (Nero, C. iv.), and illustrating the story of the marriage feast at
Cana, the staircase is apparently of wood, little better than a ladder, and
the servants who are carrying up the wine assist
themselves in mounting by means of a rope. It is
a picture which at the same time exhibits several
characteristics of domestic life&mdash;the wine vessels, the
cupboard in which they are kept, and the well in the
court-yard, the latter being indicated by the tree.
The butler, finding wine run short, sends the servant
to draw water from the well. It may be remarked
that this appears to have been the common machinery
of the draw-well among our forefathers in the
middle ages&mdash;a rude lever, formed by the attachment
of a heavy weight, perhaps of lead, at one
end of the beam, which was sufficient to raise the
other end, and thus draw up the bucket. It occurs
in illuminations in manuscripts of various periods; our example in cut
No. 57 is taken from MS. Harl. No. 1257, of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>Whatever truth there may be in William of Malmesbury‚Äôs account of
the sobriety of the Normans, there can be no doubt that the kitchen and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
the cooks formed with them a very important part of the household.
According to the Bayeux tapestry, duke William brought with him from
Normandy a complete kitchen establishment, and a compartment of that
interesting monument, of which we here give a diminished copy, shows
that when he landed he found no difficulty in providing a dinner. On
the left two cooks are boiling the meat&mdash;for this still was the general
way of cooking it, as it was usually eaten salted. Above them, on a
shelf, are fowls, and other sorts of small viands, spitted ready for roasting.
Another cook is engaged at a portable stove, preparing small cakes,
pasties, &amp;c., which he takes from the stove with a singularly formed fork
to place them on the dish. Others are carrying to the table the roasted
meats, on the spits. It will be observed that having no ‚Äúboard‚Äù with
them to form a table, the Norman knights make use of their shields
instead.</p>

<p>The reader of the life of Hereward will remember the scene in which
the hero in disguise is taken into king William‚Äôs kitchen, to entertain the
cooks. After dinner the wine and ale were distributed freely, and the
result was a violent quarrel between the cooks and Hereward; the former
used the tridents and forks for weapons (<i>cum tridentibus et furcis</i>), while
he took the spit from the fire (<i>de foco hastile</i>) as a still more formidable
weapon of defence. In the early Chanson de Roland, Charlemagne is
described also carrying his cooks with him to the war, as William the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
Conqueror is pictured in the Bayeux tapestry, and they held so important
a position in his household, that, when one of his most powerful
barons, Guenelon, was accused of treason, Charlemagne is made to
deliver him in custody to the charge of his cooks, who place him under
the guard of a hundred of the ‚Äúkitchen companions,‚Äù and these treat
him much in the same way as king William‚Äôs cooks sought to treat Hereward,
by cutting or plucking out his beard and whiskers.</p>

<p>Alexander Neckam, in his Dictionarius (written in the latter part of
the twelfth century), begins with the kitchen, as though he considered it
as the most important part of a mansion, and describes its furniture rather
minutely. There is good reason, however, for believing that the cooking
was very commonly performed in the court of the house in the open air
and perhaps it was intended to be represented so in the scene given above
from the Bayeux tapestry. The cooks are there delivering the food
through a door into the hall.</p>

<p>The Norman dinner-table, as shown in the Bayeux tapestry, differs
not much from that of the Anglo-Saxons. A few dishes and basins
contain viands which are not easy to be recognised, except the fish and
the fowls. Most of the smaller articles seem to have been given by the
cooks into the hands of the guests from the spits on which they had been
roasted. Another dinner scene is represented in our cut <a href="#n59">No. 59</a>, taken
from the Cottonian manuscript already mentioned (Nero, C. iv.). We
see again similarly formed vessels to those used at table by the Anglo-Saxons.
The bread is still made in round flat cakes, and is marked with
a cross, and with a flower in the middle. The guests use no forks; their
knives are different and more varied in their forms than under the Anglo-Saxons.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
Sometimes, indeed, the shape of the knives is almost grotesque.
The one represented below, in our cut <a href="#n60">No. 60</a>, is taken from a group
in the same manuscript which furnished the preceding cut; it is very
singularly notched at the point.</p>

<p>We see in these dinner scenes that the Anglo-Normans used horns
and cups for drinking, as the Anglo-Saxons did; but the use of the horn
is becoming rare, and the bowl-shaped vessels appear to have been now the
usual drinking cup. Among the wealthy these cups seem to have been
made of glass. Reginald of Durham describes one of
the monks as bringing water for a sick man to drink
in a glass cup (<i>vase vitreo</i>), which was accidentally
broken. In a splendidly illuminated manuscript of
the Psalms, of the earlier half of the twelfth century,
written by Eadwine, one of the monks of Canterbury, and which will
afford much illustration for this period,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> we find a figure of a servant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
giving to drink, who holds one of the same description of drinking cups
which were so popular at an earlier period among the Anglo-Saxons (see our
cut <a href="#n61">No. 61</a>). He holds in the left hand the jug, which had now become
the usual vessel for carrying the liquor in any quantity. In our cut
No. 62, furnished by the same manuscript as the preceding, the servant
is taking the jug of liquor from the barrel. Our next cut, <a href="#n63">No. 63</a>, also
taken from the Cambridge MS., represents several forms of vessels for the
table. Some of these are new to us; and they are on the whole more
elegant than most of the forms we meet
with in common pictures.</p>

<p>Wine appears to have been now more
frequently used than among the Anglo-Saxons.
Neckam, in the latter part of the
twelfth century, has given us a rather playful
enumeration of the qualities of good
wine; which he says should be as clear as
the tears of a penitent, so that a man may
see distinctly to the bottom of his glass; its
colour ‚Äúshould represent the greenness of a
buffalo‚Äôs horn; when drunk, it should descend impetuously like thunder,
sweet-tasted as an almond, creeping like a squirrel, leaping like a roebuck,
strong like the building of a Cistercian monastery, glittering like a
spark of fire, subtle as the logic of the schools of Paris, delicate as fine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
silk, and colder than crystal.‚Äù Yet still ale and mead continued to be
the usual drinks. The innumerable entries in Domesday Book show us
how large a proportion of the productions of the country, in the reign of
William the Conqueror, still consisted in honey, which was used chiefly
for the manufacture of mead. The manuscript
in Trinity College Library, gives us a
group of bee-hives (cut <a href="#n64">No. 64</a>), with peasants
attending to them; and is chiefly
curious for the extraordinary forms which
the artist, evidently no naturalist, has given
to the bees.</p>

<p>We have hardly any information on the
cookery during the period we are now
describing. It is clear that numerous delicacies were served to the
tables of the noble and wealthy, but their culinary receipts are not
preserved. We read in William of Malmesbury, incidentally, that a
great prince ate garlick with a goose, from which we are led to suppose
that the Normans were fond of highly-seasoned dishes. Neckam tells us
that pork, roasted or broiled on red embers, required no other sauce than
salt or garlick; that a capon done in gobbets should be well peppered;
that a goose, roasted on the spit, required a strong garlick-sauce, mixed
with wine or ‚Äúthe green juice of grapes or crabs;‚Äù that a hen, if boiled,
should be cut up and seasoned with cummin, but, if roasted, it should
be basted with lard, and might be seasoned with garlick-sauce, though
it would be more savoury with simple sauce; that fish should be cooked
in a sauce composed of wine and water, and that they should afterwards
be served with a sauce composed of sage, parsley, cost, ditany, wild thyme,
and garlick, with pepper and salt. We learn from other incidental allusions
of contemporary, or nearly contemporary, writers, that bread, butter, and
cheese, were the ordinary food of the common people, probably with
little else besides vegetables. It is interesting to remark that the three
articles just mentioned, have preserved their Anglo-Saxon names to the
present times, while all kinds of meat, beef, veal, mutton, pork, even
bacon, have retained only the names given to them by the Normans,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
which seems to imply that flesh-meat was not in general use for food
among the lower classes of society.</p>

<p>Bread seems almost always to have been formed in cakes, like our
buns, round in the earlier pictures, and in later ones (as in our cut <a href="#n63">No. 63</a>),
shaped more fancifully. We see it generally marked with a cross, perhaps
a superstitious precaution of the baker. The bread seems to have been
in general made for the occasion, and eaten fresh, perhaps warm. In one
of Reginald of Durham‚Äôs stories, we are told of a priest in the forest of
Arden, who, having nothing but a peck of corn left, and receiving a large
number of visitors on a sacred festival, gave it out to be baked to provide
for them. The corn was immediately ground, perhaps with querns, and
having been mixed with ‚Äúdewy‚Äù water, in the usual manner, was made
into twelve loaves, and immediately placed in the hot oven.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> Cheese
and butter seem also to have been tolerably abundant. An illuminator
of the Cambridge MS., given in our cut <a href="#n65">No. 65</a>, represents a man
milking and another churning; he who churns appears, to use a vulgar
phrase, to be ‚Äútaking it at his ease.‚Äù The milking-pail, too, is rather
extraordinary in its form.</p>

<p>We have not any distinct account of the hours at which our Norman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
ancestors took their meals, but they appear to have begun their day early.
In the Carlovingian romances, everybody, not excepting the emperor and
his court, rises at daybreak; and in Huon de Bordeaux (p. 270), one of
the chief heroes is accused of laziness, because he was in bed after the
cock had crowed. In the romance of Doon de Mayence, the feudal lord
of that great city and territory is introduced exhorting his son to rise
betimes, for, he says, ‚Äúhe who sleeps too long in the morning, becomes
thin and lazy, and loses his day, if he does not amend himself.‚Äù</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Qui trop dort au matin, maigre devient et las,</i><br /></span>

<span class="author">&mdash;Doon de Mayence, p. 76.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the same romance, two of the heroes, Doon and Baudouin, also
rise with the sun, and dress and wash, and then say their prayers; after
which their attendant, Vaudri, ‚Äúplaced between them two a very large
pasty, on a white napkin, and brought them wine, and then said to them
in fair words, like a man of sense, ‚ÄòSirs, you shall eat, if it please you; for
eating early in the morning brings great health, and gives one greater
courage and spirit; and drink a little of this choice wine, which will
make you strong and fierce in fight.‚Äô ... And when Doon saw it, he
laughed, and began to eat and drink, and they breakfasted very pleasantly
and peacefully.‚Äù John of Bromyard, who wrote at a later period, has
handed down a story of a man who despaired of overcoming the difficulty
he found in keeping the fasts, until he succeeded in the following
manner: at the hour of matins (three o‚Äôclock in the morning), when he
was accustomed to break his fast, and was greatly tempted to eat, he said
to himself, ‚ÄúI will fast until tierce (nine o‚Äôclock), for the love of God;‚Äù
and when tierce came, he said he would fast unto sext (the hour of noon),
and so again he put off eating until none (three o‚Äôclock in the afternoon);
and so he gradually learnt to fast all day. We may perhaps conclude
that, at the time when this story was made, nine o‚Äôclock was the ordinary
hour of dinner.</p>

<p>This last-mentioned meal was certainly served early in the day, and
was often followed by recreations in the open air. In the romance of
Huon de Bordeaux (p. 252), the Christian chiefs, after their dinner, go
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
to amuse themselves on the sea-shore. In Doon de Mayence (p. 245),
they play at chess and dice after dinner; and on another occasion, in the
same romance (p. 314), the barons, after their dinner, sing and dance
together; while in Fierabras (p. 185), Charlemagne and his court ride
out on horseback, and set up a quintain, at which they justed all day
(<i>tout le jour</i>&mdash;which would imply that they began early), until vespers
(probably seven o‚Äôclock), when they returned into the palace to refresh
themselves, and afterwards to go to bed. Supper was certainly served in
the evening, and in these romances people are spoken of as going to bed
immediately after it. On one occasion, in Doon de Mayence (p. 303),
Charlemagne‚Äôs barons take no supper, but, after their beds are prepared,
they are served plentifully with fruits and wine. In the same romance
(p. 16), the guards of a castle go out, because it was a warm evening in
summer, and have their supper laid out on a table in the field, where
they remain long amusing themselves. In Fierabras (p. 68), the barons
take a hot bath after dinner.</p>

<p>Of the articles of household furniture during the period of which we
are now writing, we cannot give many examples. We have every reason
to believe that they were anything but numerous. A board laid upon
tressels formed the usual dining table, and
an ordinary bench or form the seat. In
the French Carlovingian romances, the
earlier of which may be considered as
representing society in the twelfth century,
even princes and great barons sit
ordinarily upon benches. Thus, in the
romance of Huon de Bordeaux (pp. 33,
36), Charlemagne invites the young
chieftain, Huon, who had come to visit
him in his palace, to sit on the bench and
drink his wine; and in the same romance
(p. 263), when Huon was received in the abbey of St. Maurice, near
Bordeaux, he and the abbot sit together on a bench. Chairs belonged
to great people. Our cut <a href="#n66">No. 66</a>, taken from the Trinity College Psalter,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
represents a chair of state, with its covering of drapery thrown over it.
In some instances the cushion appears placed upon the drapery. This
seat was the <i>faldestol</i>, a word which has been transformed in modern
French to <i>fauteuil</i> (translated in English by elbow-chair). We read in
the Chanson de Roland of the <i>faldestol</i> which was placed for princes, and
of the covering of white ‚Äú<i>palie</i>‚Äù (a rich stuff) which was spread over it.
That of Charlemagne was of gold&mdash;

<p>The mouldings of the <i>faldestol</i> in the
cut <a href="#n66">No. 66</a> will be recognised as exactly the
same which are found on old furniture of a
much more recent period, and which, in
fact, are those which offer themselves most
readily to ordinary turners. The same
ornament is seen on the chair represented in our cut <a href="#n67">No. 67</a>, taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
from the same manuscript as the last, in which two men are seated, in
a very singular manner. It was not uncommon, however, to have
seats which held several persons together, such as the one represented in
an Anglo-Saxon illumination given in a former chapter (p. 31), and
such as are still to be seen in country public-houses, where they have
preserved the Anglo-Saxon name of <i>settle</i>. One of these is represented
in our cut <a href="#n68">No. 68</a>. The persons seated in it, in this case, are learned
men, and the cross above seems to show that they are monks. One has
a table-book, and two of the others have rolls of parchment, which are
all evidently the subject of anxious discussion.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 68. An Anglo-Norman Settle.</i></p></div>

<p>Chairs, and even stools, were, as has been already observed, by no
means abundant in these early times, and we can easily suppose that it
would be a difficult thing to accommodate numerous visitors with seats.
To remedy this, when houses were built of stone, it was usual to make,
in the public apartments, seats, like benches, in recesses in the wall, or
projecting from it, which would accommodate a number of persons at the
same time. We find such seats usually in the cloisters of monasteries, as
well as in the chapter-houses of our cathedral churches. In the latter
they generally run round the room, and are divided by arches into seats
which were evidently intended to accommodate two persons each, for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
convenience of conversation. This practice is illustrated by our cut
No. 69, taken, like the preceding one, from the Cambridge Manuscript;
it represents a group of seats of this kind, in which monks (apparently)
are seated and conversing two and two.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Alexander Neckam</span> has left us a sufficiently clear description
of the Norman hall. He says that it had a vestibule or screen
(<i>vestibulum</i>), and was entered through a porch (<i>porticus</i>), and that it had
a court, the Latin name of which (<i>atrium</i>) he pretends was derived from
<i>ater</i> (black), ‚Äúbecause the kitchens used to be placed by the side of the
streets, in order that the passers-by might perceive the smell of cooking.‚Äù
This explanation is so mysterious, that we may suppose the passage to be
corrupt, but the <i>coquin√¶</i> of which Neckam is speaking are evidently
cook‚Äôs shops. In the interior of the hall, he says, there were posts (or
columns) placed at regular distances. The few examples of Norman
halls which remain are divided internally by two rows of columns.
Neckam enumerates the materials required in the construction of the
hall, which seem to show that he is speaking of a timber building. A
fine example of a timber hall, though of a later period, is, or was recently,
standing in the city of Gloucester, with its internal ‚Äúposts‚Äù as here
described. There appears also to have been an inner court-yard, in which
Neckam intimates that poultry were kept. The whole building, and
the two court-yards, were no doubt surrounded by a wall, outside of
which were the garden and orchard. The Normans appear to have had
a taste for gardens, which formed a very important adjunct to the mansion,
and to the castle, and are not unfrequently alluded to in medi√¶val writers,
even as far back as the twelfth century. Giraldus Cambrensis, speaking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
of the castle of Manorbeer (his birthplace), near Pembroke, said that it
had under its walls, besides a fine fish-pond, ‚Äúa beautiful garden, inclosed
on one side by a vineyard, and on the other by a wood, remarkable for
the projection of its rocks, and the height of its hazel-trees.‚Äù In the
twelfth century, vineyards were not uncommon in England.</p>

<div class="figright"><img id="n70" src="images/i_n70.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 70. A Man warming himself.</i></p></div>

<p>A new characteristic was introduced into the Norman houses, and
especially into the castles, the massive walls of which allowed chimney-flues
to be carried up in their thickness. The piled-up fire in the middle
of the hall was still retained, but in the more private apartments, and
even sometimes in the hall itself, the fire was made on a hearth beneath
a fire-place built against the side wall of the
room. An illumination, in the Cottonian MS.
Nero, C. iv., which we have already had occasion
to refer to more than once, represents a
man warming himself at a fireplace of this
description. It appears, from a comparison of
this (<a href="#n70">No. 70</a>) with similar figures of a later
period, that it was a usual practice to sit at the
fire bare-legged and bare-foot, with the object
of imbibing the heat without the intermediation
of shoes or stockings. On a carved stall
in Worcester Cathedral, represented in our
cut <a href="#n71">No. 71</a>, which belongs to a later date (the
latter part of the fourteenth century), and the
scene of which is evidently intimated to be in the winter season, a man,
while occupied in attending to the culinary operations, has taken off his
shoes in order to warm himself in this manner. The winter provisions, two
flitches of bacon, are suspended to the left of him, and on the other side
the faithful dog seems to enjoy the fire equally with his master. From a
story related by Reginald of Durham, it appears to have been a practice
among the ladies to warm themselves by sitting over hot water, as well
as by the fire.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> In some of the illuminations of medi√¶val manuscripts,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
ladies are represented as warming themselves, even in the presence of the
other sex, in a very free and easy manner. The fuel chiefly employed
was no doubt still wood, but the remark of Giraldus Cambrensis that the
name of Coleshulle (in Flintshire) signified the hill of coals (<i>carbonum
collis</i>) implies that mineral coals were then known.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n71" src="images/i_n71.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 71. Indications of Cold Weather.</i></p></div>

<p>It is hardly necessary to remark that, in the change in the mode of
living which had suddenly taken place in this country, a form of society
had also been introduced abruptly which differed entirely from that of the
Anglo-Saxons. On the continent, throughout the now disjointed empire
which had once been ruled by Charlemagne, there had arisen, during the
tenth century, amid frightful misgovernment and the savage invasions of the
northmen, a new form of society, which received the name of feudalism,
because each landholder held, either direct from the crown or from a
superior baron, by a feudal tenure, or fee (<i>feodum</i>, <i>feudum</i>), which obliged
him to military service. Each baron had sovereignty over all those who
held under him, and, in turn, acknowledged the nominal sovereignty of a
superior baron or of the crown, which the latter practically was only sometimes
able to enforce. One great principle of this system was the right of
private warfare; and, as not only did the great barons obtain land in feudal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
tenure in different countries under different independent princes, but the
lesser holders of sub-fees obtained such tenures under more than one
superior lord, and as these, when they quarrelled with one superior, made
war upon him, and threw themselves upon the protection of another who
felt bound to defend his feudatory, war became the normal state of feudal
society, and peace and tranquillity were the exceptions. One effect of
feudalism was to divide the population of the country into two distinct
classes&mdash;the landholders, or fighting-men, who alone were free, and the
agricultural population, who had no political rights whatever, and were
little better than slaves attached to the land. The towns alone, by
their own innate force, preserved their independence, but in France the
influence of feudalism extended even over them, and the combined
hostility of the crown and the aristocracy finally overthrew their municipal
independence. Feudalism was brought into England by the Normans,
but it was never established here so completely or so fully as on the
continent. The towns here never lost their independence, but they
sided sometimes with the aristocracy, and sometimes with the crown,
until finally they assisted greatly in the overthrow of feudalism itself.
Yet the whole territory of England was now distributed in great fees,
and in sub-fees; amid which a few of the old Saxon gentry retained
their position, and many of the Norman intruders married the Saxon
heiresses, in order, as they thought, to strengthen the right of conquest;
but the mass of the agricultural population were confounded under the
one comprehensive name of <i>villains</i> (<i>villani</i>), and reduced to a much
more wretched condition than under the Anglo-Saxon constitution. The
light in which the villain was regarded in the twelfth century in England
is well illustrated in a story told in the English ‚ÄúRule of Nuns,‚Äù
printed by the Camden Society. A knight, who had cruelly plundered
his poor villains, was complimented by one of his flatterers, who said,
‚ÄúAh, sir! truly thou dost well. For men ought always to pluck and
pillage the churl, who is like the willow&mdash;it sprouteth out the better for
being often cropped.‚Äù</p>

<p>The power and wealth of the great Norman baron were immense,
and before him, during a great part of the period of which we are now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
speaking, the law of the land was a mere nominal institution. He was
in general proud, very tyrannical, and often barbarously cruel. A type
of the feudal baron in his worst point of view is presented to us in the
character of the celebrated Robert de Belesme, who succeeded his father
Roger de Montgomery in the earldom of Shropshire, and of whom
Henry of Huntingdon, who lived in his time, tells us, ‚ÄúHe was a very
Pluto, Meg√¶ra, Cerberus, or anything that you can conceive still more
horrible. He preferred the slaughter of his captives to their ransom.
He tore out the eyes of his own children, when in sport they hid their
faces under his cloak. He impaled persons of both sexes on stakes. To
butcher men in the most horrible manner was to him an agreeable feast.‚Äù
Of a contemporary feudal chieftain in France, the same writer tells us,
‚ÄúWhen any one, by fraud or force, fell into his hands, the captive might
truly say, ‚ÄòThe pains of hell compassed me round.‚Äô Homicide was his
passion and his glory. He imprisoned his own countess, an unheard-of
outrage; and, cruel and lewd at once, while he subjected her to fetters
and torture by day, to extort money, he forced her to cohabit with him
by night, in order to mock her. Each night his brutal followers dragged
her from her prison to his bed, each morning they carried her from
his chamber back to her prison. Amicably addressing any one who
approached him, he would plunge a sword into his side, laughing the
while; and for this purpose he carried his sword naked under his cloak
more frequently than sheathed. Men feared him, bowed down to him,
and worshipped him.‚Äù Women of rank are met with in the histories of
this period who equalled these barons in violence and cruelty; and the
relations between the sexes were marked by little delicacy or courtesy.
William the Conqueror beat his wife even before they were married.
The aristocratic class in general lived a life of idleness, which would have
been insupportable without some scenes of extraordinary excitement, and
they not only indulged eagerly in hunting, but they continually sallied
forth in parties to plunder. They looked upon the mercantile class
especially as objects of hostility; and, as they could seldom overcome them
in their towns, they waylaid them on the public roads, deprived them
of their goods and money, and carried them to their castles, where they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
tortured them in order to force them to pay heavy ransoms. The young
nobles sometimes joined together to plunder a fair or market. On the
other hand, men who could not claim the protection of aristocratic blood
for their evil deeds, established themselves under that of the wild forests,
and issued forth no less eagerly to plunder the country, and to perpetrate
every description of outrage on the persons of its inhabitants, of whatever
class they might be, who fell into their power. The purity of womanhood
was no longer prized, where it was liable to be outraged with
impunity; and immorality spread widely through all classes and ranks
of society. The declamations of the ecclesiastics and the satires of the
moralists of the twelfth century may give highly-painted pictures, but
they lead us to the conclusion that the manners and sentiments of the
female sex during the Norman period were very corrupt.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, feudalism did boast of certain dignified and generous
principles, and there were noble examples of both sexes, who shine forth
more brightly through the general prevalence of vice and of selfishness
and injustice. It was in the walls of the feudal castle, amid the familiar
intercourse which the want of amusement caused among its inmates, that
the principle, or practice, arose, which we in modern times call gallantry,
and which, though at first it only led to refinement in the forms of social
manners, ended in producing refinement of sentiments. It was among the
feudal aristocracy, too, that originated the sentiment we term chivalry,
which has varied considerably in its meaning at different periods, and
which, in its best sense, existed more in romance than in reality. After the
possession of personal strength and courage, the quality which the feudal
baron admired most, was what was termed generosity, but which meant
lavish expenditure and extravagance; it was the contrast between the
baron, who spent his money, and the burgher or merchant, who gained
it, and laid it up in his coffers. ‚ÄúNoblemen and gentlemen,‚Äù says the
‚ÄúRule of Nuns,‚Äù already quoted, ‚Äúdo not carry packs, nor go about trussed
with bundles, nor with purses; it belongs to beggars to bear bag on back,
and to burgesses to bear purses.‚Äù In fact, it was the principle of the
feudal aristocracy to extort their gains from all who laboured and trafficked,
in order to squander them on those who lived in idleness, violence, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
vice. Under such circumstances, a new class had arisen which was
peculiar to feudal society, who lived entirely upon the extravagance of
the aristocracy, and who had so completely abandoned every sentiment of
morality or shame, that, in return for the protection of the nobles, they
were the ready instruments of any base work. They were called, among
various other names, <i>ribalds</i> (<i>ribaldi</i>) and <i>letchers</i> (<i>leccatores</i>); the origin
of the first of these words is not known, but the latter is equivalent to
dish-lickers, and did not convey the sense now given to the word, but
was applied to them on account of their gluttony. We have already seen
how, in the crowd which attended the feasts of the princes and nobles,
the letchers (<i>lecheurs</i>) were not content with waiting for what was sent
away from table, but seized upon the dishes as they were carried from the
kitchen to the hall, and how it was found necessary to make a new office,
that of ushers of the hall, to repress the disorder. ‚ÄúIn those great courts,‚Äù
says the author of the ‚ÄúRule of Nuns,‚Äù ‚Äúthey are called letchers who have
so lost shame, that they are ashamed of nothing, but seek how they may
work the greatest villany.‚Äù This class spread through society like a great
sore, and from the terms used in speaking of them we derive a great part
of the opprobrious words which still exist in the English language.</p>

<p>The early metrical romances of the Carlovingian cycle give us an
insight into what were considered as the praiseworthy features in the
character of the feudal knight. In Doon of Mayence, for example, when
(p. 74) the aged count Guy sends his young son Doon into the world, he
counsels him thus: ‚ÄúYou shall always ask questions of good men, and
you shall never put your trust in a stranger. Every day, fair son, you
shall hear the holy mass, and give to the poor whenever you have money,
for God will repay you double. Be liberal in gifts to all; for the more
you give, the more honour you will acquire, and the richer you will be;
for a gentleman who is too sparing will lose all in the end, and die in
wretchedness and disgrace; but give without promising wherever you
can. Salute all people when you meet them, and if you owe anything,
pay it willingly, but if you cannot pay, ask for a respite. When you
come to the hostelry, don‚Äôt stand squabbling, but enter glad and joyously.
When you enter the house, cough very loud, for there may be something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
doing which you ought not to see, and it will cost you nothing to give
this notice of your approach, while those who happen to be there will
love you the better for it. Do not quarrel with your neighbour, and
avoid disputing with him before other people; for if he know anything
against you, he will let it out, and you will have the shame of it. When
you are at court, play at tables, and if you have any good points of
behaviour (<i>depors</i>), show them; you will be the more prized, and gain
the more advantage. Never make a noise or joke in church; this is
only done by unbelievers, whom God loves not. Honour all the clergy,
and speak fairly to them, but leave them as little of your goods as you
can; the more they get from you, the more you will be laughed at; you
will never profit by enriching them. And if you wish to save your
honour undiminished, meddle with nothing you do not understand, and
don‚Äôt pretend to be a proficient in what you have never learnt. And if
you have a valet, take care not to seat him at the table by you, or take
him to bed with you; for the more honour you do to a low fellow, the
more will he despise you. If you should know anything that you
would wish to conceal, tell it by no means to your wife, if you have one;
for if you let her know it, you will repent of it the first time you displease
her.‚Äù The estimate of the female character at this period, even when
given in the romances of chivalry, is by no means flattering.</p>

<p>With these counsels of a father, we may compare those of a mother
to her son. In the romance of Huon de Bordeaux (p. 18), when the
youthful hero leaves his home to repair to the court of Charlemagne, the
duchess addresses her son as follows: ‚ÄúMy child,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúyou are
going to be a courtier; I require you, for God‚Äôs love, have nothing to do
with a treacherous flatterer; make the acquaintance of wise men. Attend
regularly at the service of holy church, and show honour and love to
the clergy. Give your goods willingly to the poor; be courteous, and
spend freely, and you will be the more loved and cherished.‚Äù On the
whole, higher sentiments are placed in the mouth of the lady than in
that of the baron. We must, however, return to the outward, and therefore
more apparent, characteristics of social life during the Norman
period.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p>The in-door amusements of the ordinary classes of society appear not
to have undergone much change during the earlier Norman period, but
the higher classes lived more splendidly and more riotously; and, as far
as we can judge, they seem to have been coarser in manners and feelings.
The writer of the life of Hereward has left us a curious picture of
Norman revelry. When the Saxon hero returned to Brunne, to the
home of his fathers, and found that it had been taken possession of by a
Norman intruder, he secretly took his lodging in the cottage of a villager
close by. In the night he was roused from his pillow by loud sounds of
minstrelsy, accompanied with boisterous indications of merriment, which
issued from his father‚Äôs hall, and he was told that the new occupants
were at their evening cups. He proceeded to the hall, and entered the
doorstead unobserved, from whence he obtained a view of the interior of
the hall. The new lord of Brunne was surrounded by his knights, who
were scattered about helpless from the extent of their potations, and
reclining in the laps of their women. In the midst of them stood a
jougleur, or minstrel, alternately singing and exciting their mirth with
coarse and brutal jests. It is a first rough sketch of a part of medi√¶val
manners, which we shall find more fully developed at a somewhat later
period. The brutality of manners exhibited in the scene which I have
but imperfectly described, and which is confirmed by the statements of
writers of the following century, soon degenerated into heartless ferocity,
and when we reach the period of the civil wars of Stephen‚Äôs reign, we find
the amusements of the hall varied with the torture of captive enemies.</p>

<p>In his more private hours of relaxation, the Norman knight amused
himself with games of skill or hazard. Among these, the game of chess
became now very popular, and many of the rudely carved chessmen of
the twelfth century have been found in our island, chiefly in the north,
where they appear to have been manufactured. They are usually made
of the tusk of the walrus, the native ivory of Western Europe, which was
known popularly as whale‚Äôs bone. The whalebone of the middle ages
is always described as white, and it was a common object of comparison
among the early English poets, who, when they would describe the
delicate complexion of a lady, usually said that she was ‚Äúwhite as whale‚Äôs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
bone.‚Äù These, as well as dice, which were now in common use, were
also made of horn and bone, and the manufacture of such articles seems
to have been a very extensive one. Even in the little town of Kirkcudbright,
on the Scottish border, there was, in the middle of the twelfth
century, a maker of combs, draughtsmen, chessmen, dice, spigots, and
other such articles, of bone and horn, and stag‚Äôs horn appears to have
been a favourite material.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>In the Chanson de Roland, Charlemagne and his knights are represented,
after the capture of Cordova from the Saracens, as sitting in a
shady garden, some of them playing at tables, and others at chess.

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>E escremissent cil bacheler leger.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

Chess, as the higher game, is here described as the amusement of the
chiefs, the old, and the wise; the knights play at tables, or draughts;
but the young bachelors are admitted to neither of these games, they
amuse themselves with bodily exercises&mdash;sham fights.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img id="n72" src="images/i_n72.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 72. A Norman Lantern.</i></p></div>

<p>Although such games were not unusually played by day, they were
more especially the amusements which employed the long evenings of
winter, and candles appear at this time to have been more generally used
than at a former period. They still continued to be fixed on candlesticks,
and not in them, and spikes appear sometimes to have been attached to
tables or other articles of furniture, to hold them. Thus, in one of the
pretended miracles told by Reginald of Durham, a sacristan, occupied in
committing the sacred vestments to the safety of a cupboard, fixed his
candle on a stick or spike of wood on one side (<i>candelam ... in assere
collaterali confixit</i>), and forgetting to take away the candle, locked the
cupboard door, and only discovered his negligence when he found the
whole cupboard in flames. Another ecclesiastic, reading in bed, fixed his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
candle on the top of one of the sides (<i>spondilia</i>) of his bed. Another
individual bought two small candles (<i>candelas modicas</i>) for an <i>obolus</i>, but
the value of the coin thus named is not very exactly known. The candle
appears to have been usually placed at night in or on the chimney, or
fire-place, with which the chamber was now furnished. In
Fierabras (p. 93), a thief, having obtained admission in the
night to the chamber of the princess Floripas, takes a candle
from the chimney, and lights it at the fire, from which we
are led to suppose that it was usual to keep the fire alight
all night.

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Isnelement et tost vient √† la cemin√©e,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Une chandelle a prinse, au fu l‚Äôa alum√©e.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

On another occasion (p. 67), a fire is lit in the chimney of
Floripas‚Äôs chamber, and afterwards a table is laid there, and
dinner served. Lanterns were now also in general use. The
earliest figure of a lantern that I remember to have met with in an
English manuscript is one furnished by MS. Cotton. Nero, C. iv., which
is represented in our cut (<a href="#n72">No. 72</a>). It differs but little from the same
article as used in modern times; the sides are probably of horn, with a
small door through which to put the candle, and the domed cover is
pierced with holes for the egress of the smoke.

<p class="caption"><i>No. 73. Occupations of the Ladies.</i></p></div>

<p>We begin now to be a little better acquainted with the domestic
occupations of the ladies, but we shall be able to treat more fully of
these in a subsequent chapter. Not the least usual of these was weaving,
an art which appears to have been practised very extensively by the
female portion of the larger households. The manuscript Psalter in
Trinity College, Cambridge, furnishes us with the very curious group of
female weavers given in our cut <a href="#n73">No. 73</a>. It explains itself, as much, at
least, as it can easily be explained, and I will only observe that the scissors
here employed are of the form common to the Romans, to the Saxons,
and to the earlier Normans; they are the Saxon <i>scear</i>, and this name,
as well as the form, is still preserved in that of the ‚Äúshears‚Äù of the
modern clothiers. Music was also a favourite occupation, and the number
of musical instruments appears to be considerably increased. Some of
these seem to have been elaborately constructed. The manuscript last
mentioned furnishes us with the accompanying figure of a large organ, of
laborious though rather clumsy workmanship.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n74" src="images/i_n74.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 74. A Norman Organ.</i></p></div>

<p>In the dwellings of the nobles and gentry, there was more show of furniture
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
under the Normans than under the Saxons. Cupboards (<i>armaria,
armoires</i>) were more numerous, and were filled with vessels of earthenware,
wood, or metal, as well as with other things. Chests and coffers
were adorned with elaborate carving, and were sometimes inlaid with
metal, and even with enamel. The smaller ones were made of ivory,
or bone, carved with historical subjects. Rich ornamentation generally
began with ecclesiastics, and we find by the subjects carved upon them
that the earlier ivory coffers or caskets belonged to churchmen. When
they were made for lords and ladies, they were usually ornamented with
subjects from romance, or from the current literature of the day. The
beds, also, were more ornamental, and assumed novel forms. Our cut
No. 75, taken from MS. Cotton. Nero, C. iv., differs little from some
of the Anglo-Saxon figures of beds. But the tester bed, or bed with a
roof at the head, and hangings, was now introduced. In Reginald of
Durham, we are told of a sacristan who was accustomed to sit in his bed
and read at night. One night, having fixed his candle upon one of the
sides of the bed (<i>supra spondilia lectuli suprema</i>), he fell accidentally
asleep. The fire communicated itself from the candle to the bed, which,
being filled with straw, was soon enveloped in flame, and this communicated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
itself with no less rapidity to the combination of arches and planks
of which the frame of the bed was composed (<i>ligna materies archarum et
asserum copiosa</i>). Above the bed was a wooden frame (<i>qu√¶dam tabularia
stratura</i>), on which he was accustomed to pile the curtains, dorsals, and
other similar furniture of the church. Neckam, in the latter part of the
twelfth century, describes the chamber as having its walls covered with a
curtain, or tapestry. Besides the bed, he says, there should be a chair,
and at the foot of the bed a bench. On the bed was placed a quilt
(<i>culcitra</i>) of feathers (<i>plumalis</i>), to which is joined a pillow; and this is
covered with a pointed (<i>punctata</i>) or striped (<i>stragulata</i>) quilt, and a
cushion is placed upon this, on which to lay the head. Then came
sheets (<i>lintheamina, linceuls</i>), made sometimes of rich silks, but more
commonly of linen, and these were covered with a coverlet made of
green say, or of cloth made of the hair of the badger, cat, beaver, or
sable. On one side of the chamber was a <i>perche</i>, or pole, projecting from
the wall, for the falcons, and in another place a similar perch for hanging
articles of dress. It was not unusual to have only one chamber in the
house, in which there were, or could be made, several beds, so that all
the company, even if of different sexes, slept in the same room. Servants
and persons of lower degree might sleep unceremoniously in the hall.
In the romance of Huon de Bordeaux (p. 270), Huon, his wife, and his
brother, when lodged in a great abbey, sleep in three different beds in
the same room, no doubt in the guest-house. Among the Anglo-Normans,
the chamber seems to have frequently, if not generally, occupied
an upper floor, so that it was approached by stairs.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 75. A Norman Bed.</i></p></div>

<p>The out-of-doors amusements of this period appear in general to have
been rude and boisterous. The girls and women seem to have been
passionately fond of the dance, which was their common amusement at
all public festivals. The young men applied themselves to gymnastic
exercises, such as wrestling, and running, and boxing; and they had bull-baitings,
and sometimes bear-baitings. On Roman sites, the ancient
amphitheatres seem still to have been used for such exhibitions; and the
Roman amphitheatre at Banbury, in Oxfordshire, was known by the title
of ‚ÄúThe Bull-ring‚Äù down to a very late period. The higher ranks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
among the Normans were extraordinarily addicted to the chace, to secure
which they adopted severe measures for preserving the woods and the
beasts which inhabited them. Every reader of English history knows the
story of the New Forest, and of the fate which there befell the great
patron of hunting&mdash;William Rufus. The Saxon Chronicle, in summing
up the character of William the Conqueror, tells us that he ‚Äúmade large
forests for the deer, and enacted laws therewith, so that whoever killed a
hart or a hind, should be blinded. As he forbade killing the deer, so also
the boars; and he loved the tall stags as if he were their father. He
also appointed concerning the hares, that they should go free.‚Äù The
passion of the aristocracy for hunting was a bane to the rural population
in more ways than one. Not only did they ride over the cultivated
lands, and destroy the crops, but wherever they came they lived at free
quarter on the unfortunate population, ill-treating the men, and even
outraging the females, at will. John of Salisbury complains bitterly of
the cruelty with which the country-people were treated, if they happened
to be short of provisions when the hunters came to their houses. ‚ÄúIf
one of these hunters come across your land,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúimmediately and
humbly lay before him everything you have in your house, and go and
buy of your neighbours whatever you are deficient of, or you may be
plundered and thrown into prison for your disrespect to your betters.‚Äù
The weapons generally used in hunting the stag were bows and arrows.
It was a barbed arrow which pierced the breast of the second William,
when he was hunting the stag in the wilds of the New Forest. Our
cut (<a href="#n76">No. 76</a>), from the Trinity College Psalter, represents a horseman
hunting the stag. The noble animal is closely followed by a brace of
hounds, and just as he is turning up a hill, the huntsman aims an arrow
at him. As far as we can gather from the few authorities in which it is
alluded to, the Saxon peasantry were not unpractised hands at the bow.
We find them enjoying the character of good archers very soon after
the Norman conquest, under circumstances which seem to preclude the
notion that they derived their knowledge of this arm from the invaders.
In the miracles of St. Bega, printed by Mr. G. C. Tomlinson, in 1842,
there is a story which shows the skill of the young men of Cumberland in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
archery very soon after the entrance of the Normans; and the original
writer, who lived perhaps not much after the middle of the twelfth
century, assures us that the Hibernian Scots, and the men of Galloway,
who were the usual enemies of the men of Cumberland, ‚Äúfeared these
sort of arms more than any others, and called an arrow, proverbially, a
<i>flying devil</i>.‚Äù We learn from this and other accounts, that the arrows of
this period were barbed and fledged, or furnished with feathers. It may
be observed, in support of the assertion that the use of bows and arrows
was derived from the Saxons, that the names <i>bow</i> (<i>boga</i>) and <i>arrow</i>
(<i>arewe</i>), by which they have always been known, are taken directly from
their language; whereas, if the practice of archery had been introduced
by the Normans, it is probable we should have called them <i>arcs</i> and
<i>fletches</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n76" src="images/i_n76.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 76. A Stag-hunt.</i></p></div>

<p>After the entrance of the Normans, we begin to find more frequent
allusions to the convivial meetings of the middle and lower orders in
ordinary inns or private houses. Thus, we have a story in Reginald of
Durham, of a party of the parishioners of Kellow, who went to a drinking
party at the priest‚Äôs, and passed in this manner a great portion of the
night.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> This occurred in the time of bishop Geoffrey Rufus, between
1133 and 1140. A youth and his monastic teacher are represented on
another occasion as going to a tavern, and passing the whole of the night
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
in drinking, till one of them becomes inebriated, and cannot be prevailed
on to return home. Another of Reginald‚Äôs stories describes a party in a
private house, sitting and drinking round the fire. We are obliged thus
to collect together slight and often trivial allusions to the manners of a
period during which we have so few detailed descriptions. Hospitality
was at this time exercised among all classes freely and liberally; the
misery of the age made people meet together with more kindliness.
The monasteries had their open guest-houses, and the unknown traveller
was seldom refused a place at the table of the yeoman. In towns, most
of the burgesses or citizens were in the habit of receiving strangers as
private lodgers, in addition to the accommodation afforded in the regular
<i>hospitia</i> or taverns. Travelling, indeed, was more usual under the
Normans than it had been under the Saxons, for it was facilitated by the
more extensive use of horses. But this also brought serious evils upon
the country; for troops of followers and rude retainers who attended on
the proud and tyrannical aristocracy, were in the habit of taking up their
lodgings at will and discretion, and living upon the unfortunate householders
without pay. It had been, even during the Anglo-Saxon period,
a matter of pride and ostentation among men of rank&mdash;especially the
king‚Äôs officers&mdash;to travel about accompanied with a great multitude of
followers,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> and this practice certainly did not diminish under the Normans.
But, whether in great numbers or in small, the travellers of the
twelfth century sought the means of amusing themselves during their
journey, and these amusements resembled some of those which were
employed at the dinner-table&mdash;they told stories, or repeated episodes
from romances, or sung, and they sometimes had minstrels to accompany
them. In the romance of Huon de Bordeaux, Huon, on his journey from
his native city to Paris, asks his brother Gerard to sing, to enliven them on
the road,&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Cante, biau frere, pour nos cors esjoir.</i><br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Huon de Bordeaux, p. 18.<br /></span>
</span></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>

But Gerard declines, because a disagreeable dream of the preceding night
has made his heart sorrowful. When we turn from romance to sober
history, we learn from Giraldus Cambrensis how Gilbert de Clare,
journeying from England to his great possessions in Cardiganshire, was
preceded by a minstrel and a singing-man, who played and sang alternately,
and how the noise they made gave notice of his approach to the
Welshmen who lay in ambush to kill him.</p>

<p>A group of Norman travellers is here given from the Cottonian MS.
Nero, C. iv. It is intended to represent Joseph and the Virgin Mary
travelling into Egypt. The Virgin on the ass, or mule, is another example
of the continued practice among ladies of riding sideways. Mules appear
to have been the animals on which ladies usually rode at this period.
In the romance of Huon de Bordeaux (p. 60), when Huon, immediately
after his marriage, proceeds on his journey homeward, he mounts his
young duchess on a mule; so also, in the romance of Gaufrey (p. 62), the
princess Flordespine is mounted on ‚Äúa rich mule,‚Äù the trappings of which
are rather minutely described. ‚ÄúThe saddle was of ivory, inset with
gold; on the bridle there was a gem of such power that it gave light in
the darkness of night, and whoever bore it was preserved from all disease;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
the saddle-cloth (<i>sambue</i>) was wonderfully made; she had thirty little
bells behind the <i>cuirie</i>, which, when the mule ambled, made so great a
melody that harp or viol were worth nothing in comparison.‚Äù The
Anglo-Norman historian, Ordericus Vitalis, has preserved a legend of a
vision of purgatory, in which the priest who is
supposed to have seen it describes, among other
suffering persons, ‚Äúa crowd of women who seemed
to him to be innumerable. They were mounted
on horseback, riding in female fashion, with
women‚Äôs saddles.... In this company the
priest recognised several noble ladies, and beheld
the palfreys and mules, with the women‚Äôs litters,
of others who were still alive.‚Äù The Trinity
College Psalter furnishes us with the two figures
of cars given in our cut <a href="#n78">No. 78</a>; but they are so
fanciful in shape, that we can hardly help concluding
they must have been mere rude and grotesque attempts at
imitating classical forms.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n79" src="images/i_n79.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 79. The Stocks.</i></p></div>

<p>The manuscript last mentioned affords us two other curious illustrations
of the manners of the earlier half of the twelfth century. The first of
these (<a href="#n79">No. 79</a>) represents two men in the stocks, one held by one leg only,
the other by both. The men to the left are hooting and insulting them.
The second, represented in our cut <a href="#n80">No. 80</a>, is the interior of a Norman
school. We give only a portion of the original, where the bench, on
which the scholars are seated, forms a complete circle. The two writers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
the teacher, who seems to be lecturing <i>viva voce</i>, and his seat and desk,
are all worthy of notice. We have very little information on the forms
and methods of teaching in schools at this period, but schools seem to
have been numerous in all parts of the country. We have more than
one allusion to them in the <i>na√Øve</i> stories of Reginald of Durham. From
one of these we learn that a school, according to a custom ‚Äúnow common
enough,‚Äù was kept in the church of Norham, on the Tweed, the parish
priest being the teacher. One of the boys, named Aldene, had incurred
the danger of correction, to escape which he took the key of the church
door, which appears to have been in his custody, and threw it into a deep
pool in the river Tweed, then called Padduwel, and now Pedwel or
Peddle, a place well known as a fishing station. He hoped by this means
to escape further scholastic discipline, from the circumstance that the
scholars would be shut out by the impossibility of opening the church
door. Accordingly, when the time of vespers came, and the priest
arrived, the key of the door was missing, and the boy declared that he

did not know where it was. The lock was too strong and ponderous to
be broken or forced, and, after a vain effort to open the door, the
evening was allowed to pass without divine service. The story goes on
to say, that in the night St. Cuthbert appeared to the priest, and inquired
wherefore he had neglected his service. On hearing the explanation, the
saint ordered him to go next morning to the fishing station at Padduwel,
and buy the first net of fish that was drawn out of the river. The priest
obeyed, and in the net was a salmon of extraordinary magnitude, in the
throat of which was found the lost key of Norham church.</p>

<p>Among the aristocracy of the land, the education of the boy took
what was considered at that time a very practical turn&mdash;he was instructed
in behaviour, in manly exercises and the use of arms, in carving at table&mdash;then
looked upon as a most important accomplishment among gentlemen&mdash;and
in some other branches of learning which we should hardly appreciate
at present; but school learning was no medi√¶val gentleman‚Äôs
accomplishment, and was, in that light, quite an exception, unless perhaps
to a certain degree among the ladies. In the historical romances of the
middle ages, a prince or a baron is sometimes able to read, but it is the
result of accidental circumstances. Thus, in the romance of the ‚ÄúMort
de Garin,‚Äù when the empress of the Franks writes secret news from
Paris to duke Garin, the head of the family of the Loherains, it is
remarked, as an unusual circumstance, that the latter was able to read,
and that he could thus communicate the secret information of the empress
to his friends without the assistance of a scholar or secretary, which was a
great advantage, as it prevented one source of danger of the betrayal of
the correspondence. ‚ÄúGarin the Loherain,‚Äù says the narrator, ‚Äúwas
acquainted with letters, for in his infancy he was put to school until he
had learned both Roman (French) and Latin.‚Äù</p>

<p>Education of this kind was bestowed more generally on the <i>bourgeoisie</i>&mdash;on
the middle and even the lower classes; and to these school-education
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
was much more generally accessible than we are accustomed to
imagine. From Anglo-Saxon times, indeed, every parish church had
been a public school. The Ecclesiastical Institutes (p. 475, in the folio
edition of the Laws, by Thorpe) directs that ‚ÄúMass-priests ought always
to have at their houses a school of disciples; and if any one desire to
commit his little ones (<i>lytlingas</i>) to them for instruction, they ought very
gladly to receive them, and kindly teach them.‚Äù It is added that ‚Äúthey
ought not, however, for that instruction, to desire anything from their
relatives, except what they shall be willing to do for them of their own
accord.‚Äù In the Ecclesiastical Canons, published under king Edgar,
there is an enactment which would lead us to suppose that the clergy
performed their scholastic duties with some zeal, and that priests were
in the habit of seducing their scholars from each other, for this enactment
(p. 396) enjoins ‚Äúthat no priest receive another‚Äôs scholar without
leave of him whom he previously followed.‚Äù This system of teaching was
kept up during at least several generations after the Norman conquest.

<span class="small table">EARLY ENGLISH HOUSES.&mdash;THEIR GENERAL FORM AND DISTRIBUTION.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">After</span> the middle of the twelfth century, we begin to be better
acquainted with the domestic manners of our forefathers, and
from that period to the end of the fourteenth century the change was
very gradual, and in many respects they remained nearly the same. In
the middle classes, especially in the towns, there had been a gradual
fusion of Norman and Saxon manners, while the Norman fashions and
the Norman language prevailed in the higher classes, and the manners of
the lower classes remained, probably, nearly the same as before the
Conquest.</p>

<p>We now obtain a more perfect notion of the houses of all classes, not
only from more frequent and exact descriptions, but from existing remains.
The principal part of the building was still the hall, or, according to the
Norman word, the <i>salle</i>, but its old Saxon character seems to have been
so universally acknowledged, that the first or Saxon name prevailed over
the other. The name now usually given to the whole dwelling-house
was the Norman word <i>manoir</i> or manor, and we find this applied popularly
to the houses of all classes, excepting only the cottages of labouring
people. In houses of the twelfth century, the hall, standing on the
ground floor, and open to the roof, still formed the principal feature of
the building. The chamber generally adjoined to it at one end, and at
the other was usually a stable (<i>croiche</i>). The whole building stood within
a small enclosure, consisting of a yard or court in front, called in Norman
<i>aire</i> (area), and a garden, which was surrounded usually with a hedge
and ditch. In front, the house had usually one door, which was the
main entrance into the hall. From this latter apartment there was a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
door into the chamber at one end, and one into the <i>croiche</i> or stable at
the other end, and a back door into the garden. The chamber had also
frequently a door which opened also into the garden; the stable, as a
matter of course, would have a large door or outlet into the yard. The
chief windows were those of the hall. These, in common houses, appear
to have been merely openings, which might be closed with wooden
shutters; and in other parts of the building they were nothing but holes
(<i>pertuis</i>); there appears to have been usually one of these holes in the
partition wall between the chamber and the hall, and another between
the hall and the stable. There was also an outer window, or <i>pertuis</i>, to
the chamber.</p>

<p>In the popular French and Anglo-Norman <i>fabliaux</i>, or tales in verse,
which belong mostly to the thirteenth century, we meet with many
incidents illustrating this distribution of the apartments of the house, which
no doubt continued essentially the same during that and the following
century. Thus in a fabliau published by M. Jubinal, an old woman of
mean condition in life, dame Auber√©e, is described as visiting a burgher‚Äôs
wife, who, with characteristic vanity, takes her into the chamber adjoining
(<i>en une chambre ilueques pr√®s</i>), to show her her handsome bed. When
the lady afterwards takes refuge with dame Auber√©e, she also shows her
out of the hall into a chamber close adjoining (<i>en une chambre iluec de
joste</i>). In a fabliau entitled <i>Du prestre crucifi√©</i>, published by M√©on, a
man returning home at night, sees what is going on in the hall through
a <i>pertuis</i>, or hole made through the wall for a window, before he opens
the door (<i>par un pertuis les a veuz</i>). In another fabliau published in the
larger collection of Barbazan, a lady in her chamber sees what is passing
in the hall <i>par un pertuis</i>. In the fabliau of <i>Le povre clerc</i> (or scholar),
the clerc, having asked for a night‚Äôs lodging at the house of a miller
during the miller‚Äôs absence, is driven away by the wife, who expects a
visit from her lover the priest, and is unwilling to have an intruder.
The clerc, as he is going away, meets the miller, who, angry at the
inhospitable conduct of his dame, takes him back to the house. The
priest in the meantime had arrived, and is sitting in the hall with the
good wife, who, hearing a knock at the door, makes her lover hide himself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
in the stable (<i>croiche</i>). From the stable the priest watches the
company in the hall through a window (<i>fenestre</i>), which is evidently
only another name for the <i>pertuis</i>. In one fabliau the gallant comes
through the court or garden, and is let into the hall by the back door;
in another a woman is introduced into the chamber by a back door, or,
as it is called in the text, a false door (<i>par un fax huis</i>), while the hall is
occupied by company.</p>

<p>The arrangements of an ordinary house in the country are illustrated
in the fabliau <i>De Barat et de Haimet</i>, printed in the collection of Barbazan.
Two thieves undertake to rob a third of ‚Äúa bacon,‚Äù which he
(Travers) had hung on the beam or rafter of his house, or hall:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Travers l‚Äôavoit √† une hart</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Au tref de sa meson pendu.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The thieves make a hole in the wall, by which one enters without
waking Travers or his wife, although they were sleeping with the door
of their chamber open. The bacon is thus stolen and carried away.
Travers, roused by the noise of their departure, rises from his bed, follows
the thieves, and ultimately recaptures his bacon. He resolves now to
cook the bacon, and eat some of it, and for this purpose a fire is made,
and a cauldron full of water hung over it. This appears to be performed
in the middle of the hall. The thieves return, and, approaching the
door, one of them looked through the <i>pertuis</i>, and saw the bacon
boiling:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Baras mist son oeil au pertuis,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Et voit que la chaudiere bout.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The thieves then climb the roof, uncover a small space at the top silently,
and attempt to draw up the bacon with a hook.</p>

<p>From the unskilfulness of the medi√¶val artists in representing details
where any knowledge of perspective was required, we have not so much
information as might be expected from the illuminated manuscripts
relating to the arrangements of houses. But a fine illuminated copy of
the romances of the San Graal and the Round Table, executed at the
beginning of the fourteenth century, and now preserved in the British
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
Museum (MS. Addit. Nos. 10,292-10,294), furnishes us with one or
two rather interesting illustrations of this subject. The romances themselves
were composed in Anglo-Norman, in the latter half of the twelfth
century. The first cut which we shall select from this manuscript is a
complete view of a house; it belongs to a chapter entitled <i>Ensi que
Lancelot ront les fers d‚Äôune fenestre, et si entre dedens pour gesir avoec la
royne</i>. The queen has informed Lancelot that the head of her bed lies
near the window of her chamber, and that he may come by night to the
window, which is defended by an iron grating, to talk with her, and she
tells him that the wall of the adjacent hall is in one part weak and
dilapidated enough to allow of his obtaining an entrance through it; but
Lancelot prefers breaking open the grating in order to enter directly into
the chamber, to passing through the hall. The grating of the chamber
window appears to have been common in the houses of the rich and
noble; in the records of the thirteenth century, the grating of the
chamber windows of the queen is often mentioned. The window behind
Lancelot in our cut is that of the hall, and is distinguished by architectural
ornamentation. The ornamental hinges of the door, with the lock and
the knocker, are also curious. Our next cut (<a href="#n82">No. 82</a>), taken from this same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
manuscript, represents part of the house of a knight, whose wife has an
intrigue with one of the heroes of these romances, king Claudas. The
knight lay in wait to take the king, as he was
in the lady‚Äôs chamber at night, but the king,
being made aware of his danger, escaped by
the chamber-window, while the knight expected
to catch him by entering at the hall
door. The juxtaposition of hall and chamber
is here shown very plainly. In another chapter
of the same romances, the king takes Lancelot
into a chamber to talk with him apart, while
his knights wait for them in the hall; this
is pictorially represented in an illumination
copied in the accompanying cut (<a href="#n83">No. 83</a>), which shows exactly the relative
position of the hall and chamber. The door here is probably
intended for that which led from the hall into the chamber.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 83. The Knights in waiting.</i></p></div>

<p>We see from continual allusions that an ordinary house, even among
men of wealth, had usually only one chamber, which served as his
sleeping-room, and as the special apartment of the female portion of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
household&mdash;the lady and her maids, while the hall was employed indiscriminately
for cooking, eating and drinking, receiving visitors, and a
variety of other purposes, and at night it was used as a common sleeping-room.
These arrangements, and the construction of the house, varied
according to the circumstances of the locality and the rank of the
occupiers. Among the rich, a stable did not form part of the house, but
its site was often occupied by the kitchen, which was almost always
placed close to the hall. Among the higher classes other chambers were
built, adjacent to the chief chamber, or to the hall, though in larger
mansions they sometimes occupied a tower or separate building adjacent.
The form, however, which the manor-house
generally took was a simple oblong square.
A seal of the thirteenth century, attached
to a deed by which, in June, 1272, William
Moraunt grants to Peter Picard an acre of
land in the parish of Otteford in Kent, furnishes
us with a representation of William
Moraunt‚Äôs manor-house. It is a simple square
building, with a high-pitched roof, as appears
always to have been the case in the early
English houses, and a chimney. The hall
door, it will be observed, opens outwardly, as
is the case in the preceding cuts, which was the ancient Roman manner
of opening of the outer door of the house; it may be added that it was
the custom to leave the hall door or <i>huis</i> (<i>ostium</i>) always open by day, as
a sign of hospitality. It will also be observed that there is a curious
coincidence in the form of chimney with the cuts from the illuminated
manuscript. We must not overlook another circumstance in these
delineations,&mdash;the position of the chimney, which is usually over the
chamber, and not over the hall. Fireplaces in the wall and chimneys
were first introduced in the chamber.</p>

<div class="figright"><img id="n84" src="images/i_n84.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 84. Seal of W. Moraunt.</i></p></div>

<p>As the grouping together of several apartments on the ground-floor
rendered the whole building less compact and less defensible, the practice
soon rose, especially in the better <i>manoirs</i>, of making apartments above.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
This upper apartment was called a <i>soler</i> (<i>solarium</i>, a word supposed to
be derived from <i>sol</i>, the sun, as being, by its position, nearer to that
luminary, or as receiving more light from it). It was at first, and in the
lesser mansions, but a small apartment raised above the chamber, and
approached by a flight of steps outside, though (but more rarely) the
staircase was sometimes internal. In our first cut from the Museum manuscript
(<a href="#n81">No. 81</a>), there is a soler over the chamber, to which the approach
appears to be from the inside. In the early metrical tales the <i>soler</i>, and
its exterior <i>staircase</i>, are often alluded to. Thus, in the fabliau <i>D‚ÄôEstourmi</i>,
in Barbazan, a burgher and his wife deceive three monks of a neighbouring
abbey who make love to the lady; she conceals her husband
in the soler above, to which he ascends by a flight of steps:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Tesiez, vous monterez l√† sus</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>En cel solier tout coiement.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The monk, before he enters the house, passes through the court (<i>cortil</i>),
in which there is a sheepcot (<i>bercil</i>), or perhaps a stable. The husband
from the soler above looks through a lattice or grate and sees all that
passes in the hall&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Par la treillie le porlingne.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The stairs seem, therefore, to have been outside the hall, with a latticed
window looking into it from the top. The monk appears to have
entered the hall by the back door, and the chamber is adjacent to the
hall (as in houses which had no soler), on the side opposite to that on
which were the stairs. When another monk comes, the husband hides
himself under the stairs (<i>souz le degr√©</i>). The bodies of the monks (who
are killed by the husband) are carried out <i>parmi une fausse posterne</i> which
leads into the fields (<i>aus chans</i>). In the fabliau of <i>La Saineresse</i>, a
woman who performs the operation of bleeding comes to the house of a
burgher, and finds the man and his wife seated on a bench in the yard
before the hall&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>En mi l‚Äôaire de sa meson.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The lady says she wants bleeding, and takes her upstairs into the soler:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Montez l√† sus en cel solier,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Il m‚Äôestuet de vostre mestier.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>

They enter, and close the door. The apartment on the soler, although
there was a bed in it, is not called a chamber, but a room or saloon
(<i>perrin</i>):&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Si se descendent del perrin,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Contreval les degrez enfin</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Vindrent errant en la maison.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The expression that they came down the stairs, and <i>into the house</i>, shows
that the staircase was outside.</p>

<p>In another fabliau, <i>De la borgoise d‚ÄôOrliens</i>, a burgher comes to his
wife in the disguise of her gallant, and the lady, discovering the fraud,
locks him up in the soler, pretending he is to wait there till the household
is in bed&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Je vous metrai priv√©ement</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>En un solier dont j‚Äôai la clef.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

She then goes to meet her <i>ami</i>, and they come from the garden (<i>vergier</i>)
direct into the chamber without entering the hall. Here she tells him
to wait while she goes <i>in there</i> (<i>l√† dedans</i>), to give her people their
supper, and she leaves him while she goes into the hall. The lady afterwards
sends her servants to beat her husband, pretending him to be an
importunate suitor whom she wishes to punish! ‚Äúhe waits for me up
there in that room:‚Äù&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>L√† sus m‚Äôatent en ce perin.</i><br /></span>
<span style="letter-spacing: 1em" class="i0">       *       *       *       *       *<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ne souffrez pas que il en isse,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ainz l‚Äôacueillier al solier haut.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

They beat him as he descends the stairs, and pursue him into the garden,
all which passes without entering the lower apartments of the house.
The <i>soler</i>, or upper part of the house, appears to have been considered
the place of greatest security&mdash;in fact it could only be entered by one
door, which was approached by a flight of steps, and was therefore more
easily defended than the ground floor. In the beautiful story <i>De l‚Äôermite
qui s‚Äôacompaigna √† l‚Äôange</i>, the hermit and his companion seek a night‚Äôs
lodging at the house of a rich but miserly usurer, who refuses them
admittance into the house, and will only permit them to sleep under the
staircase, in what the story terms an <i>auvent</i> or shed. The next morning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
the hermit‚Äôs young companion goes upstairs into the soler to find the
usurer, who appears to have slept there for security&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Le vallet les degrez monta,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>El solier son hoste trova.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

It was in the thirteenth century a proverbial characteristic of an avaricious
and inhospitable person, to shut his hall door and live in the soler. In a
poem of this period, in which the various vices of the age are placed
under the ban of excommunication, the miser is thus pointed out:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Encor escommeni-je plus</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Riche homme qui ferme son huis,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Et va mengier en solier sus.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The <i>huis</i> was the door of the hall. The soler appears also to have been
considered as the room of honour for rich lodgers or guests who paid well.
In the fabliau <i>Des trois avugles de Compiengne</i>, three blind men come to
the house of a burgher, and require to be treated better than usual; on
which he shows them upstairs&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>En la haute logis les maine.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

A clerc, who follows, after putting his horse in the stable, sits at table
with his host in the hall, while the three other guests are served ‚Äúlike
knights‚Äù in the soler above&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Et li avugle du solier</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Furent servi com chevalier.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n85" src="images/i_n85.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 85. Ancient Manor-House, Millichope, Shropshire.</i></p></div>

<p>During the period of which we are speaking, the richer the householder,
the greater need he had of studying strength and security, and
hence with him the soler, or upper story, became of more importance,
and was often made the principal part of the house, at least that in which
himself and his family placed themselves at night. This was especially
the case in stone buildings, where the ground-floor was often a low
vaulted apartment, which seems to have been commonly looked upon as
a cellar, while the principal room was on the first-floor, approached
usually by a staircase on the outside. A house of this kind is represented
in one of our cuts taken from the Bayeux tapestry, where the guests are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
carousing in the room on the first-floor. Yet still the vaulted room on
the ground-floor was perhaps more often considered as the public apartment.
In this manner the two apartments of the house, instead of
standing side by side, were raised one upon the other, and formed externally
a square mass of masonry. Several examples of early manor-houses
of this description still remain, among which one of the most remarkable
is that at Millichope in Shropshire; which evidently belongs to the latter
half of the twelfth century. It has not been noticed in any work on
domestic architecture, but I am enabled to describe it from two private
lithographed plates by Mrs. Stackhouse Acton, of Acton Scott, from which
the accompanying cuts are taken. The first (<a href="#n85">No. 85</a>) represents the present
outward appearance of the ancient building, which is now an adjunct to a
farm-house. The plan is a rectangle, considerably longer from north to
south than in the transverse direction. The walls are immensely thick
on the ground-floor in comparison to the size of the building, as will be
seen from the plan of the ground-floor given in the next cut (<a href="#n86">No. 86</a>).
The original entrance was at <i>b</i>, by a late Norman arch, slightly ornamented,
which is seen in the view. To the right of this is seen one of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
original windows, also round arched. On the north and east sides were
two other windows, the openings of them all being small towards the
exterior, but enlarging inwards. The interior must have been extremely
dark; nevertheless it contains a fireplace, and was probably the public
room. The opening at <i>a</i> is merely a modern passage into the farm-house.
As this house stands on the borders of Wales, and therefore security was
the principal consideration, the staircase, from the thickness of the walls,
was safer inside than on the exterior. We accordingly find that it was
worked into the mass of the wall in the south-west corner, the entrance
being at <i>c</i>. The steps of the lower part&mdash;it was a stone staircase&mdash;are
concealed or destroyed, so that we hardly know how it commenced, but
there are steps of stone now running up to the soler or upper apartment,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
as represented in our plan of the upper floor. This staircase received
light at the bottom and at the top, by a small loop-hole worked through
the wall. Although the walls were so massive in the lower room, the
staircase was secured by extraordinary precautions. At the top of the
steps at <i>d</i>, again at <i>e</i>, and a third time at <i>f</i>, were strong doors, secured
with bolts, which it would have required great force to break open. The
last of these doors led into the upper apartment, which was rather larger
than the lower one, the west wall being here much thinner. This was
evidently the family apartment; it had two windows, on the north and
east sides, each having seats at the side, with ornamentation of early
English character. A view of the northern window from the interior,
with its seats, is given in our cut <a href="#n88">No. 88</a>; it is the same which is seen
externally in our sketch of the house: this room had no fireplace.</p>

<p>Towards the fourteenth century, the rooms of houses began to be
multiplied, and they were often built round a court; the additions were
made chiefly to the offices, and to the number of chambers. They were
still built more of wood than of stone, and the carpenter was the chief
person employed in their construction. In the fabliau of Trubert, printed
by M√©on, a duke, intending to build a new house, employs a carpenter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
to make the design, and takes him into his woods to select timber for
materials. It may give some notion of the simplicity of the arrangement
of a house, and the small number of rooms, even when required for
royalty itself, when we state that in the January of 1251, king Henry III.,
intending to visit Hampshire, and requiring a house for himself with his
queen and court, gave orders to the sheriff of Southampton to build at
Freemantle a hall, a kitchen, and a chamber with an upper story (<i>cum
estagio</i>, sometimes called in documents written in French <i>chambre estag√©e</i>),
and a chapel on the ground, for the king‚Äôs use; and a chamber with an
upper story, with a chapel at the end of the same chamber, for the
queen‚Äôs use. Under the chamber was to be made a cellar for the king‚Äôs
wines.</p>

<p>The chamber had, indeed, now become so important a part of the
building, that its name was not unusually given to the whole house, which,
in the documents of the thirteenth century, is sometimes called a <i>camera
ad estagiam</i>&mdash;an upper-storied chamber. Such was the case with a house
built in 1285 for Edward I. and his queen in the forest at Woolmer, in
Hampshire, the account of the expenses of which are preserved in the
Pipe Rolls. This house was seventy-two feet long, and twenty-eight
feet wide. It had two chimneys, a chapel, and two wardrobes. The
chapel and wardrobe had six glazed windows. There was also a hall in
it, but the two chimneys appear to have belonged to the chamber. The
windows of the chamber and hall had wooden shutters (<i>hostia</i>), but do
not appear to have had glass. The kitchen was the only other apartment
in the house. The ordinary windows of a house at this time were
not usually glazed; but they were either latticed, or consisted of a mere
opening, which was covered by a cloth or curtain by day, and was closed
by a shutter, which turned upon hinges, either sideways, like an ordinary
door, or up and down, and which seems generally to have opened outwards.
The rooms were, in this manner, very imperfectly protected
against the weather, even in palaces. A precept of Henry III. has been
quoted, which directs glass to be substituted for wood in a window in the
queen‚Äôs wardrobe at the Tower, ‚Äúin order that that chamber might not
be so windy;‚Äù and in the same reign a charge is made in the accounts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
relating to the royal manor at Kennington, ‚Äúfor closing the windows
better than usual (<i>et in fenestris melius solito claudendis</i>).‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>These remarks on the general character of the house are, of course,
intended to apply to the ordinary dwelling-house, and not to the more
extensive mansion&mdash;which already in the thirteenth century was made to
surround, wholly or partly, an interior court&mdash;or to the castle. These more
extensive edifices consisted only of a greater accumulation of the rooms
and details which were found in the smaller house. During the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries, no great change took place in the general
characteristics of a private house. The hall was still the largest and most
important room, and was now usually raised on an under vaulted room,
which, to whatever use it may have been applied, was usually called the
<i>cellar</i>. Part of it appears to have been sometimes employed as the stable.
In the carpenter‚Äôs house, in Chaucer‚Äôs Milleres Tale, the hall, which is
evidently the main part of the building, was open to the roof, with cross
beams, on which they hanged the troughs, and the stable was attached to
it, and intervened between the house and the garden. In the Cokes
Tale of Gamelyn, the hall has its posts, or columns, and there is attached
to it a room called a <i>spence</i>, which was more frequently called the
<i>buttery</i>, in which victuals of different kinds, and the wine and plate, were
locked up, and the man who had the charge of it was called the <i>spencer</i>
or <i>despencer</i>, which it is hardly necessary to say was the origin of two
common English surnames. The gentleman‚Äôs house, in Chaucer‚Äôs
Sompnoures Tale, was a ‚Äúlarge halle,‚Äù and is called a <i>court</i>, which had
now become an ordinary term for a manor-house.

<span class="author">&mdash;Chaucer‚Äôs Cant. Tales, l. 7,744.<br /></span>
</span></span>

In the Nonne Prestes Tale, the poor widow‚Äôs cottage also has its hall and
<i>bour</i>, or chamber, although they were all sooty, of course, from the fires,
which had no chimney to carry off the smoke.

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134<br /></span>
</span></span>

This house was situated within a court, or, as it is called, <i>yard</i>, which was
enclosed by a hedge of sticks, and by a ditch:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>A yerd sche had, enclosed al aboute</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With stikkes, and a drye dich withoute.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

In the Tale of Gamelyn, the yard, or court, as we use the Anglo-Saxon
or the Anglo-Norman name for it, had a stronger fence, with a gate and
wicket fastened by lock and bolt, and apparently a lodge for the porter.
In the yard there was a draw-well, seven fathoms deep. While Gamelyn
took possession of the hall, his brother shut himself up in the cellar, which
could be made a safe place of refuge, when all the rest of the house was
in the power of an enemy. The yard here had also a postern-gate. In
the carpenter‚Äôs house, in Chaucer‚Äôs Milleres Tale, the chamber has a low
window, to swing outwardly&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Unto his brest it raught, it was so lowe.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A new apartment had now been added to the house, called in Anglo-Norman
a parlour (<i>parloir</i>), because it was literally the talking-room.
It belonged originally to the monastic houses, where the parlour was the
room for receiving people who came to converse on business, and, when
introduced into private houses, it was a sort of secondary hall, where
visitors might be received more privately than in the great hall, and yet
with less familiarity than in the chamber. In the story of Sir Cleges,
the knight finds the king seated in his parlour, and listening to a harper.
In a Latin document of the year 1473, printed in Rymer‚Äôs F≈ìdera, a
citizen of London has, in his mansion-house there, a parlour adjoining
the garden (<i>in quadam parlura adjacente gardino</i>).</p>

<p>Houses were, as I have before stated, usually built in great part of
timber, and it was only where unusual strength was required, or else from
a spirit of ostentation, that they were made of stone. There appear to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
have been very few fixtures in the inside, and, as furniture was scanty, the
rooms must have appeared very bare.
In timber houses, of course, it was
not easy to make cupboards or closets
in the walls, but this was not the
case when they were built of stone.
Even in the latter case, however,
the walls appear not to have been
much excavated for such purposes.
Our cut <a href="#n89">No. 89</a> represents a cupboard
door, taken from an illuminated
manuscript of the thirteenth
century, in the Bodleian Library at
Oxford; it is curious for its ironwork,
especially the lock and key.
The smaller articles of domestic use were usually deposited in chests, or
placed upon sideboards and moveable
stands. In the houses of the
wealthy a separate room was built
for the wardrobe.</p>

<p>The accompanying figure (cut
No. 90), taken from a manuscript
in the Cottonian Library (Nero,
D. vii.), represents the cellarer,
or house-steward, of the abbey of
St. Alban‚Äôs, in the fourteenth century,
carrying the keys of the
cellar door, which appear to be of
remarkably large dimensions; he
holds the two keys in one hand, and
a purse, or, rather, a bag of money,
in the other, the symbols of his
office. A drawing in the same MS.,
copied in our cut <a href="#n91">No. 91</a>, shows us the entrance-door to an ordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
house, with a soler, or upper room, above. The individual intended to
be represented was Alan Middleton, who is recorded in the catalogue
of officers of St. Alban‚Äôs as ‚Äúcollector of rents of the obedientiaries of
that monastery, and especially of those of the bursar.‚Äù A small tonsure
denotes him as a monastic officer, while the penner and inkhorn at his
girdle denote the nature of his office; and he is just opening the door of
one of the abbey tenants to perform his function. The door is intended
to be represented opening outwards. These Benedictines of St. Alban‚Äôs
have also immortalised another of their inferior officers, Walterus de
Hamuntesham, who was attacked and grievously wounded by the rabble
of St. Alban‚Äôs, while standing up for the rights and liberties of the
church. He appears (cut <a href="#n92">No. 92</a>) to be attempting to gain shelter in a
house, which also has a soler.</p>

<p>There was one fixture in the interior of the house, which is frequently
mentioned in old writers, and must not be overlooked. It was frequently
called a <i>perche</i> (<i>pertica</i>), and consisted of a wooden frame fixed to the
wall, for the purpose of hanging up articles of clothing and various other
things. The curious tract of Alexander Neckam, entitled <i>Summa de</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
<i>nominibus utensilium</i>, states that each chamber should have two perches,
one on which the domestic birds, hawks and falcons, were to sit, the other
for suspending shirts, kerchiefs, breeches, capes, mantles, and other articles
of clothing. In reference to the latter usage, one of the medi√¶val Latin
poets has the memorial line&mdash;</p>

<p>Our cut <a href="#n93">No. 93</a>, taken from a manuscript of the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>,
written in the fourteenth century, and now preserved in the National
Library in Paris (No. 6985, fol. 2, v<sup>o</sup>), represents a perche, with two garments
suspended upon it. The one represented in our next cut (<a href="#n94">No. 94</a>) is
of rather a different form, and is made to support the arms of a knight, his
helmet, sword, and shield, and his coat of mail; but how the sword and
helmet are attached to it is far from clear. This example is taken from an
illuminated manuscript of a well-known work by Guillaume de Deguilleville,
<i>Le Pelerinage de la Vie humaine</i>, of the latter end of the fourteenth
century, also preserved in the French National Library (No. 6988):
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
another copy of the same work, preserved in the same great collection
(No. 7210), but of the fifteenth century, gives a still more perfect representation
of the perche, supporting, as in the last example, a helmet, a
shield, and coats of mail. In the foreground, a queen is depositing the
staff and scrip of a hermit in a chest, for greater security. This subject is
represented in our cut <a href="#n95">No. 95</a>.</p>

<p>Furniture of every kind continued to be rare, and chairs were by no
means common articles in ordinary houses. In the chambers, seats were
made in the masonry by the side of the windows, as represented in our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
cut <a href="#n88">No. 88</a>, and sometimes along the walls. Common benches were the
usual seats, and these were often formed by merely laying a plank upon
two trestles. Such a bench is probably represented in the accompanying
cut (<a href="#n96">No. 96</a>), taken from a manuscript of the romance of Tristan, of the
fourteenth century, preserved in the National Library at Paris (No. 7178).
Tables were made in the same manner. We now, however, find not unfrequent
mention of a <i>table dormant</i> in the hall, which was of course a table
fixed to the spot, and which was not taken away like the others: it was
probably the great table of the <i>dais</i>, or upper end of the hall. To ‚Äúbegin
the table dormant‚Äù was a popular phrase, apparently equivalent to taking
the first place at the feast. Chaucer, in the prologue to the Canterbury
Tales, describing the profuse hospitality of the Frankeleyn, says&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>His table dormant in his halle alway</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Stood redy covered al the longe day.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
Yet, during the whole of this period, it continued to be the common
practice to make the table for a meal, by merely laying a board upon
trestles. The second cut on the preceding page (<a href="#n97">No. 97</a>) is a very curious
representation of such a table, from a manuscript of the thirteenth century,
preserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford (MS. Arch. A. 154).
It must be understood that the objects which are ranged alternately with
the drinking-vessels are loaves of bread, not plates.</p>

DINNER-TABLE.&mdash;MINSTRELSY.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">As</span> I have already stated, the hall continued to be the most important
part of the house; and in large mansions it was made of proportional
dimensions. It was a general place of rendezvous for the
household, especially for the retainers and followers, and in the evening
it seems usually to have been left entirely to them, and they made their
beds and passed the night in it. Strangers or visitors were brought into
the hall. In the curious old poem edited by Mr. Halliwell, entitled
‚ÄúThe Boke of Curtasye,‚Äù we find especial directions on this subject.
When a gentleman or yeoman came to the house of another, he was
directed to leave his weapons with the porter at the outward gate or
wicket, before he entered. It appears to have been the etiquette that if
the person thus presenting himself were of higher rank than the person
he visited, the latter should go out to receive him at the gate; if the
contrary, the visitor was admitted through the gate, and proceeded to
the hall.

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>The porter thou shalle fynde therate;</i><br /></span>

At the hall door the visitor was to take off his hood and gloves&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>When thow come tho halle dor to,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Do of thy hode, thy gloves also.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

If, when he entered the hall, the visitor found the family at meat, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
stood at the bottom of the apartment in a respectful attitude, till the lord
of the house sent a servant to lead him to a place where he was to sit at
table. As you descended lower in society, such ceremonies were less
observed; and the clergy in general seem to have been allowed a much
greater licence than the laity. In the Sompneres Tale, in Chaucer, when
the friar, who has received an insult from an inferior inhabitant, goes ‚Äúto
the court‚Äù to complain to the lord of the village, he finds the latter in
his hall at the dinner table&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

</span></span>

The lord, surprised at the agitation in the countenance of the friar, who
had come in without any sort of introduction, invites him to sit down,
and inquires into his business. There is a scene in the early English
metrical romance of Ipomydon, in which this hero and his preceptor
Tholoman go to the residence of the heiress of Calabria. At the castle
gate they were stopped by the porter, whom they ask to announce them
in the hall:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The porter to theyme they gan calle,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And prayd hym, ‚ÄòGo into the halle,</i><br /></span>

<span class="author">&mdash;Weber, Metr. Rom. ii. 290.<br /></span>
</span></span>

The porter ‚Äúcourteously‚Äù undertook the message, and, at the immediate
order of the lady, who was sitting at her meat, he went back, took
charge of their horses and pages, and introduced them into the hall.
Then they asked to be taken into the lady‚Äôs service, who accepted their
offer, and invited them to take their place at the dinner:&mdash;</p>

<p>Perhaps, before entering the medi√¶val hall, we shall do well to give
a glance at the kitchen. It is an opinion, which has not unfrequently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
been entertained, that living in the middle ages was coarse and not
elaborate; and that old English fare consisted chiefly in roast beef and
plum-pudding. That nothing, however, could be more incorrect, is fully
proved by the rather numerous medi√¶val cookery books which are still
preserved, and which contain chiefly directions for made dishes, many of
them very complicated, and, to appearance, extremely delicate. The
office of cook, indeed, was one of great importance, and was well paid;
and the kitchens of the aristocracy were very extensive, and were furnished
with a considerable variety of implements of cookery. On
account, no doubt, of this importance, Alexander Neckam, although an
ecclesiastic, commences his vocabulary (or, as it is commonly entitled,
Liber de Utensilibus), compiled in the latter part of the twelfth century,
with an account of the kitchen and its furniture. He enumerates, among
other objects, a table for chopping and mincing herbs and vegetables;
pots, trivets or tripods, an axe, a mortar and pestle, a mover, or pot-stick,
for stirring, a crook or pot-hook (<i>uncus</i>), a caldron, a frying-pan, a gridiron,
a posnet or saucepan, a dish, a platter, a saucer, or vessel for mixing
sauce, a hand-mill, a pepper-mill, a mier, or instrument for reducing
bread to crumbs. John de Garlande, in his ‚ÄúDictionarius,‚Äù composed
towards the middle of the thirteenth century, gives a similar enumeration;
and a comparison of the vocabularies of the fifteenth century, shows that
the arrangements of the kitchen had undergone little change during the
intervening period. From these vocabularies the following list of kitchen
utensils is gathered:&mdash;a brandreth, or iron tripod, for supporting the
caldron over the fire; a caldron, a dressing-board and dressing-knife, a
brass-pot, a posnet, a frying-pan, a gridiron, or, as it is sometimes called,
a roasting-iron; a spit, a ‚Äúgobard,‚Äù explained in the MS. by <i>ipegurgium</i>;
a mier, a flesh-hook, a scummer, a ladle, a pot-stick, a slice for turning
meat in the frying-pan, a pot-hook, a mortar and pestle, a pepper-quern,
a platter, a saucer.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 98. Making the Pot boil.</i></p></div>

<p>The older illuminated manuscripts are rarely so elaborate as to furnish
us with representations of all these kitchen implements; and, in fact, it
is not in the more elaborately illuminated manuscripts that kitchen scenes
are often found. But we meet with representations of some of them in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
artistic sketches of a less elaborate character, though these are generally
connected with the less refined processes of cookery. The medi√¶val
landlords were obliged to consume the produce of the land on their own
estates, and, for this and other very cogent reasons, a large proportion
of the provisions in ordinary use consisted of salted meat, which was laid
up in store in vast quantities in the baronial larders. Hence boiling was
a much more common method of cooking meat than roasting, for which,
indeed, the medi√¶val fire, placed on the ground, was much less convenient;
it is, no doubt, for this reason that the cook is most frequently
represented in the medi√¶val drawings with the caldron on the fire. In
some instances, chiefly of the fifteenth century, the caldron is supported
from above by a pot-hook, but more usually it stands over the fire upon
three legs of its own, or upon a three-legged frame. A manuscript in
the British Museum of the fourteenth century (MS. Reg. 10, E. iv.),
belonging formerly to the monastery of St. Bartholomew in Smithfield,
contains a series of such illustrations, from which the following are selected.
In the first of these (<a href="#n98">No. 98</a>) it is
evidently a three-legged caldron
which stands over the fire, to
increase the heat of which the
cook makes use of a pair of bellows,
which bears a remarkably
close resemblance to the similar
articles made in modern times.
Bellows were certainly in common
use in Anglo-Saxon times, for the name is Anglo-Saxon, <i>b√¶lg</i>, <i>b√¶lig</i>,
and <i>bylig</i>; but as the original meaning of this word was merely a <i>bag</i>, it
is probable that the early Anglo-Saxon bellows was of very rude character:
it was sometimes distinguished by the compound name, <i>blast-b√¶lg</i>, a blast-bag,
or bellows. Our second example from this MS. (cut <a href="#n99">No. 99</a>) is one
of a series of designs belonging to some medi√¶val story or legend, with
which I am not acquainted. A young man carrying the vessel for the
holy water, and the aspersoir with which it was sprinkled over the people,
and who may therefore be supposed to be the holy-water clerc, is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
making acquaintance with the female cook. The latter seems to have
been interrupted in the act of taking some object out of the caldron with
a flesh-hook. The caldron here again is three-legged. In the sequel,
the acquaintance between the cook and the holy-water clerc appears to
have ripened into love; but we may presume from the manner in which
it was represented (<a href="#n100">No. 100</a>), that this love was not of a very disinterested
character on the part of the clerc, for he is taking advantage of her
affection to steal the animal which she is boiling in the caldron. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
conventional manner in which the animal seems to be drawn, renders it
difficult to decide what that animal is. The medi√¶val artists show a taste
for playful delineations of this kind, which occur not unfrequently in
illuminated manuscripts, and in carvings and sculptures. One of the
stalls in Hereford cathedral, copied in the accompanying cut (<a href="#n101">No. 101</a>),
represents a scene of this description.
A man is attempting to take
liberties with the cook, who has in
return thrown a platter at his head.
In our next cut (<a href="#n102">No. 102</a>), taken
from another MS. in the British
Museum, also of the fourteenth
century (MS. Reg. 16, E. viii.),
the object cooked in the caldron is
a boar‚Äôs head, which the cook, an
ill-favoured and hump-backed man,
is placing on a dish to be carried to
the table. The caldron, in this instance, appears to be intended to
have been of more ornamental character than the others.</p>

<p>It will have been remarked that in most of these pictures the process
of cookery appears to have been carried on in the open air, for, in one
instance, a tree stands not far from the caldron. This appears, indeed, to
have been frequently the case, and there can be no doubt that it was
intended to be so represented in our next cut (<a href="#n103">No. 103</a>), taken from the
well-known manuscript of the romance of ‚ÄúAlexander,‚Äù in the Bodleian
Library, at Oxford. We have here the two processes of boiling and
roasting, but the latter is only employed for fowls (geese in this case).
While the cook is basting them, the <i>quistron</i>, or kitchen-boy, is turning
the spit, which is supported in a very curious manner on one leg of the
tripod or trivet, on which the caldron is here supported. The building
to the right is shown by the sign to be an inn, and we are, probably, to
suppose, that this out-of-door cooking is required by some unusual festivity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 103. Boiling and Roasting.</i></p></div>

<p>Although meat was, doubtless, sometimes roasted, this process seems
to have been much more commonly applied to poultry and game, and
even fresh meat was very usually boiled. One cause of this may, perhaps,
have been, that it seems to have been a common practice to eat the meat,
and even game, fresh killed&mdash;the beef or mutton seems to have been
often killed for the occasion on the day it was eaten. In the old fabliau
of the ‚ÄúBouchier d‚ÄôAbbeville‚Äù (Barbazan, tom. iv. p. 6), the butcher,
having come to Bailueil late in the evening, and obtained a night‚Äôs
lodging at the priest‚Äôs, kills his sheep for the supper. The shoulders were
to be roasted, the rest, as it appears, was recommended to be boiled.
The butchers, indeed, seem usually to have done their work in the
kitchen, and to have killed and cut up the animals for the occasion.
There is a curious story in the English Gesta Romanorum (edited by
Sir Frederic Madden), which illustrates this practice. ‚ÄúC√¶sar was emperor
of Rome, that had a forest, in the which he had planted vines and
other divers trees many; and he ordained over his forest a steward, whose
name was Jonatas, bidding him, upon pain, to keep the vines and the
plants. It fell, after this ordinance of the emperor, that Jonatas took the
care of the forest; and upon a day a swine came into the forest, the new
plants he rooted up. When Jonatas saw the swine enter, he cut off his
tail, and the swine made a cry, and went out. Nevertheless, he entered
again, and did much harm in the forest. When Jonatas saw that, he
cut off his left ear; and the hog made a great cry, and went out.
Notwithstanding this, he entered again the third day; and Jonatas saw
him, and cut off his right ear, and with a horrible cry he went out. Yet
the fourth day the swine re-entered the forest, and did much damage.
When Jonatas saw that the hog would not be warned, he smote him
through with his spear, and slew him, and delivered the body to the
cook for to array the next day to the emperor‚Äôs meat. But when the
emperor was served of this swine, he asked of his servants, ‚ÄòWhere is
the heart of this swine?‚Äô&mdash;because the emperor loved the heart best of
any beast, and more than all the beast. The servants asked the cook
where the heart of the swine was, for the lord inquired after it. The
cook, when he had arrayed the heart, saw it was good and fat, and eat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
it; and he said to the servants, ‚ÄòSay to the emperor that the hog had
no heart.‚Äô The emperor said, ‚ÄòIt may not be; and therefore say to him,
upon pain of death, that he send me the heart of the swine, for there is
no beast in all the world without a heart.‚Äô The servants went to the
cook with the emperor‚Äôs orders; and he replied, ‚ÄòSay to my lord, but
if I prove mightily by clear reasons that the swine had no heart, I put
me fully to his will, to do with me as he likes.‚Äô The emperor, when
he heard this, assigned him a day to answer. When the day was come,
the cook, with a high voice, said before all men, ‚ÄòMy lord, this is the
day of my answer. First I shall show you that the swine had no heart;
this is the reason. Every thought cometh from the heart, therefore every
man or beast feeleth good or evil; it followeth of necessity that by this
the heart thinketh.‚Äô The emperor said, ‚ÄòThat is truth.‚Äô ‚ÄòThen,‚Äô said
the cook, ‚Äònow shall I show by reasons that the swine had no heart.
First he entered the forest, and the steward cut off his tail; if he had had
a heart, he should have thought on his tail that was lost, but he thought
not thereupon, for afterwards he entered the forest, and the forester
cut off his left ear. If he had had a heart, he should have thought on
his left ear, but he thought not, for the third time he entered the forest.
That saw the forester, and cut off his right ear; where, if he had had
a heart, he should have thought that he had lost his tail and both his
ears, and never should have gone again where he had so many evils.
But yet the fourth time he entered the forest, and the steward saw
that, and slew him, and delivered him to me to array to your meat.
Here may ye see, my lord, that I have shown, by worthy reasons, that
the swine had no heart.‚Äô And thus escaped the cook.‚Äù</p>

<p>The story which follows this in the Gesta, tells of an emperor named
‚ÄúAlexaundre,‚Äù ‚Äúwho of great need ordained for a law, that no man
should turn the plaice in his dish, but that he should only eat the white
side, and in no wise the black side; and if any man did the contrary, he
should die!‚Äù It is hardly necessary to remark, that fish was a great
article of consumption in the middle ages, and especially among the
ecclesiastics and monks. The accompanying cut on the following page
(<a href="#n104">No. 104</a>), from a manuscript of the fourteenth century in the British
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
Museum (MS. Harl. No. 1527), represents probably the steward of a
monastery receiving a present of fish.</p>

<p>In large houses, and on great occasions, the various meats and dishes
were carried from the kitchen to the hall with extraordinary ceremony
by the servants of the kitchen, who delivered them at the entrance of
the hall to other attendants of a higher class, who alone were allowed to
approach the tables. Our cut <a href="#n105">No. 105</a>, from MS. Reg. 10, E. iv., represents
one of these servants carrying a pot and platter, or stand for the pot,
which, perhaps, contained gravy or soup. The roasts appear to have been
usually carried into the hall on the spits, which, among people of great
rank, were sometimes made of silver; and the guests at table seem to
have torn, or cut, from the spit what they wanted. Several early
illuminations represent this practice of people helping themselves from
the spits, and it is alluded to, not very unfrequently, in the medi√¶val
writers. In the romance of ‚ÄúParise la Duchesse,‚Äù when the servants
enter the hall with the meats for the table, one is described as carrying
a roasted peacock on a spit:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Atant ez les serjanz qui portent le mangier;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Li uns porte .i. paon roti en un astier.</i><br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Romans de Parise, p. 172.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the romance of ‚ÄúGarin le Loherain,‚Äù on an occasion when a
quarrel began in the hall at the beginning of the dinner, the duke Begon,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
for want of other weapons, snatched from the hands of one of the attendants
a long spit ‚Äúfull of plovers, which were hot and roasted:‚Äù&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Li dus avoit un grant hastier saisi,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Plain de ploviers, qui chaut sunt et rosti.</i><br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Romans de Garin, ii. 19.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the most curious illustration of the universality of this practice is
found in a Latin story, probably of the thirteenth century, in which we
are told of a man who had a glutton for his wife. One day he roasted
for their dinner a fowl, and when they had sat down at the table, the
wife said, ‚ÄúGive me a wing?‚Äù The husband gave her the wing; and,
at her demand, all the other members in succession, until she had devoured
the whole fowl herself, at which, no longer able to contain his anger, he
said, ‚ÄúLo, you have eaten the whole fowl yourself, and nothing remains
but the spit, which it is but right that you should taste also.‚Äù And
thereupon he took the spit, and beat her severely with it.</p>

<p>Our cut (<a href="#n106">No. 106</a>), taken from a large illumination, given from a
manuscript of the fifteenth century by the late M. du Sommerard, in his
great work on medi√¶val art, represents the servants of the hall, headed
by the steward, or <i>ma√Ætre d‚Äôh√¥tel</i>, with his rod of office, bringing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
dishes to the table in formal procession. Their approach and arrival were
usually announced by the sounding of trumpets and music. The servants
were often preceded by music, as we see in our cut <a href="#n107">No. 107</a>, taken
from a very fine MS. of the early part of the fourteenth century,
in the British Museum (MS. Reg. 2, B. vii.). A representation of a
similar scene occurs at the foot of the large Flemish brass of Robert
Braunche and his two wives at St. Margaret‚Äôs Church, Lynn, which is
intended as a delineation of a feast given by the corporation of Lynn to
king Edward III. Servants from both sides of the picture are bringing
in that famous dish of chivalry, the peacock with his tail displayed; and
two bands of minstrels are ushering in the banquet with their strains; the
date of the brass is about 1364 <small>A.D.</small> Those who served at the table
itself, whose business was chiefly to carve and present the wine, were of
still higher rank&mdash;never less than esquires&mdash;and often, in the halls of
princes and great chiefs, nobles and barons. The meal itself was conducted
with the same degree of ceremony, of which a vivid picture may
be drawn from the directions given in the work called the ‚ÄúM√©nagier de
Paris,‚Äù composed about the year 1393. When it was announced that
the dinner was ready, the guests advanced to the hall, led ceremoniously
by two <i>ma√Ætres d‚Äôh√¥tel</i>, who showed them their places, and served them
with water to wash their hands before they began. They found the
tables spread with fine table-cloths, and covered with a profusion of
richly-ornamented plate, consisting of salt-cellars, goblets, pots or cups for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
drinking, spoons, &amp;c. At the high table, the meats were eaten from
slices of bread, called trenchers (<i>tranchoirs</i>), which, after the meats were
eaten, were thrown into vessels called <i>couloueres</i>. In a conspicuous part
of the hall stood the dresser or cupboard, which was covered with vessels
of plate, which two esquires carried thence to the table, to replace those
which were emptied. Two other esquires were occupied in bringing
wine to the dresser, from whence it was served to the guests at the tables.
The dishes, forming a number of courses, varying according to the occasion,
were brought in by valets, led by two esquires. An <i>ass√©eur</i>, or
placer, took the dishes from the hands of the valets, and arranged them
in their places on the table. After these courses, fresh table-cloths were
laid, and the <i>entremets</i> were brought, consisting of sweets, jellies, &amp;c.,
many of them moulded into elegant or fantastic forms; and, in the
middle of the table, raised above the rest, were placed a swan, peacocks,
or pheasants, dressed up in their feathers, with their beaks and feet gilt.
In less sumptuous entertainments the expensive course of <i>entremets</i> was
usually omitted. Last of all came the dessert, consisting of cheese, confectionaries,
fruit, &amp;c., concluded by what was called the <i>issue</i> (departure
from table), consisting usually of a draught of hypocras, and the <i>boute-hors</i>
(turn out), wine and spices served round, which terminated the repast.
The guests then washed their hands, and repaired into another room,
where they were served with wine and sweetmeats, and, after a short
time, separated. The dinner, served slowly and ceremoniously, must
have occupied a considerable length of time. After the guests had left
the hall, the servers and attendants took their places at the tables.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n108" src="images/i_n108.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 108. The Seat on the Dais.</i></p></div>

<p>The furniture of the hall was simple, and consisted of but a few
articles. In large residences, the floor at the upper end of the hall was
raised, and was called the <i>dais</i>. On this the chief table was placed,
stretching lengthways across the hall. The subordinate tables were
arranged below, down each side of the hall. In the middle was
generally the fire, sometimes in an iron grate. At the upper end of the
hall there was often a cup-board or a dresser for the plate, &amp;c. The
tables were still merely boards placed on tressels, though the table dormant,
or stationary table, began to be more common. Perhaps the large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
table on the dais was generally a table dormant. The seats were merely
benches or forms, except the principal seat against the wall on the dais,
which was often in the form of a settle, with back and elbows. Such a
seat is represented in our cut <a href="#n108">No. 108</a>, taken from a manuscript of the
romance of Meliadus, in the National Library at Paris, No. 6961. On
special occasions, the hall was hung round with tapestry, or curtains,
which were kept for that purpose, and one of these curtains seems commonly
to have been suspended against the wall behind the dais. A
carpet was sometimes laid on the floor, which, however, was more
usually spread with rushes. Sometimes, in the illuminations, the floor
appears to be paved with ornamental tiles, without carpet or rushes. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
was also not unusual to bring a chair into the hall as a mark of particular
respect. Thus, in the English metrical romance of Sir Isumbras:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Until comparatively a very recent date, the hour of dinner, even
among the highest classes of society, was ten o‚Äôclock in the forenoon.
There was an old proverb which defined the divisions of the domestic
day as follows:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Lever √† six, disner √† dix,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Souper √† six, coucher √† dix.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

Which is preserved in a still older and more complete form as follows:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Lever √† cinq, diner √† neuf,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Souper √† cinq, coucher √† neuf,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fait vivre d‚Äôans nonante et neuf.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

Five o‚Äôclock was the well-known hour of the afternoon meal; and nine
seems formerly to have been an ordinary hour for dinner. In the time
of Chaucer, the hour of <i>prime</i> appears to have been the usual dinner
hour, which perhaps meant nine o‚Äôclock. At least the monk, in the
Schipmannes Tale, calls for dinner at prime:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‚Äú<i>Goth now your way,‚Äù quod he, ‚Äúal stille and softe,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And let us dyne as sone as ye may,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For by my chilindre it is prime of day.</i>‚Äù<br /></span>
</span></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>

And the lady to whom this is addressed, in reply, expresses impatience, lest
they should pass the hour. The dinner appears to have been usually
announced by the blowing of horns. In the romance of Richard C≈ìur
de Lion, on the arrival of visitors, the tables were laid out for dinner&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="caption"><i>No. 109. Washing before Dinner.</i></p></div>

<p>Before the meal, each guest was served with water to wash. It was
the business of the ewer to serve the guests with water for this purpose,
which he did with a jug and basin, while another attendant stood by
with a towel. Our cut <a href="#n109">No. 109</a>, represents this process; it is taken from
a fine manuscript of the ‚ÄúLivre de la Vie Humaine,‚Äù preserved in the
National Library in Paris, No. 6988. In the originals of this group, the
jug and basin are represented as of gold. In the copy of the Seven
Sages, printed by Weber (p. 148), the preparations for a dinner are thus
described:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Thai set trestes, and bordes on layd;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Thai spred clathes and salt on set,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And made redy unto the mete;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Thai set forth water and towelle.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The company, however, sometimes washed before going to the table, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
for this purpose there were lavours, or lavatories, in the hall itself, or
sometimes outside. The signal for washing was then given by the
blowing of trumpets, or by the music of the minstrels. Thus, in the
English metrical romance of Richard C≈ìur de Lion,

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<i>At noon √† laver the waytes blewe</i>,<br />
</span></span>

meaning, of course, the canonical hour of <i>none</i>. Grace was also said at the
commencement, or at the end, of the meal, but this part of the ceremony
is but slightly alluded to in the old writers.</p>

<p>Having washed, the guests seated themselves at table. Then the
attendants spread the cloths over the tables; they then placed on them
the salt-cellars and the knives; and next the bread, and the wine in
drinking cups. All this is duly described in the following lines of an old
romance:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Quant lav√© orent, si s‚Äôasistrent,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Et li serjant les napes mistrent,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Desus les dobliers blans et biax,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Les saliers et les coutiax,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Apr√®s lou pain, puis lo vin</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Et copes d‚Äôargent et d‚Äôor fin.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

Spoons were also usually placed on the table, but there were no forks,
the guests using their fingers instead, which was the reason they were so
particular in washing before and after meat. The tables being thus
arranged, it remained for the cooks to serve up the various prepared
dishes.</p>

<p>At table the guests were not only placed in couples, but they also eat
in couples, two being served with the same food and in the same plate.
This practice is frequently alluded to in the early romances and fabliaux.
In general the arrangement of the couples was not left to mere chance,
but individuals who were known to be attached to each other, or who
were near relatives, were placed together. In the poem of La Mule sanz
Frain, the lady of the castle makes Sir Gawain sit by her side, and eat
out of the same plate with her, as an act of friendly courtesy. In the
fabliau of Trubert, a woman, taken into the household of a duke, is seated
at table beside the duke‚Äôs daughter, and eats out of the same plate with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
her, because the young lady had conceived an affectionate feeling for the
visitor. So, again, in the story of the provost of Aquil√©e, the provost‚Äôs
lady, receiving a visitor sent by her husband (who was absent), placed
him at table beside her, to eat with her, and the rest of the party were
similarly seated, ‚Äútwo and two:‚Äù&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>La dame premi√®re s‚Äôassist,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Son hoste lez lui seoir fist,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Car mengier voloit avec lui;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Li autre furent dui et dui.</i><br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;M√©on Fabliaux, ii. 192.<br /></span>
</span></span>

In one of the stories in the early English Gesta Romanorum, an earl and
his son, who dine at the emperor‚Äôs table, are seated together, and are
served with one plate, a fish, between them. The practice was, indeed,
so general, that the phrase ‚Äúto eat in the same dish‚Äù (<i>manger dans la m√™me
√©cuelle</i>), became proverbial for intimate friendship between two persons.</p>

<p>There was another practice relating to the table which must not be
overlooked. It must have been remarked that, in the illuminations of
contemporary manuscripts which represent dinner scenes, the guests are
rarely represented as eating on plates. In fact, only certain articles were
served in plates. Loaves were made of a secondary quality of flour, and
these were first pared, and then cut into thick slices, which were called,
in French, <i>tranchoirs</i>, and, in English, <i>trenchers</i>, because they were to be
carved upon. The portions of meat were served to the guests on these
<i>tranchoirs</i>, and they cut it upon them as they eat it. The gravy, of
course, went into the bread, which the guest sometimes, perhaps always
at an earlier period, eat after the meat, but in later times, and at the
tables of the great, it appears to have been more frequently sent away to
the alms-basket, from which the leavings of the table were distributed to
the poor at the gate. All the bread used at table seems to have been
pared, before it was cut, and the parings were thrown into the alms-dish.
Walter de Bibblesworth, in the latter part of the thirteenth century,
among other directions for the laying out of the table, says, ‚ÄúCut the
bread which is pared, and let the parings be given to the alms‚Äù&mdash;

The use of the <i>tranchoir</i>, which Froissart calls a <i>tailloir</i>, is not unfrequently
alluded to in the older French writers. That writer tells the
story of a prince who, having received poison in a powder, and suspecting
it, put it on a <i>tailloir</i> of bread, and thus gave it to a dog to eat. One of
the French poets of the fifteenth century, Martial de Paris, speaking
against the extravagant tables kept by the bishops at that time, exclaims,
‚ÄúAlas! what have the poor? They have only the tranchoirs of bread
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
which remain on the table.‚Äù An ordinance of the dauphin Humbert II.,
of the date of 1336, orders that there should be served to him at table
every day ‚Äúloaves of white bread for the mouth, and four small loaves to
serve for tranchoirs‚Äù (<i>pro incisorio faciendo</i>). For great people, a silver
platter was often put under the tranchoir, and it was probable from the
extension of that practice that the tranchoirs became ultimately abandoned,
and the platters took their place.</p>

<p>We give three examples of dinner-scenes, from manuscripts of the fourteenth
century. The first, cut <a href="#n110">No. 110</a> (on the last page), is taken from a
manuscript belonging to the National Library in Paris, No. 7210, containing
the ‚ÄúP√©lerinage de la Vie Humaine.‚Äù The party are eating fish, or rather
have been eating them, for the bones and remnants are strewed over the
table. We have, in addition to these, the bread, knives, salt-cellars, and
cups; and on the ground a remarkable collection of jugs for holding the
liquors. Our second example, cut <a href="#n111">No. 111</a>, is taken from an illuminated
manuscript of the romance of Meliadus, preserved in the British Museum
(Additional MS., No. 12,228). We have here the curtain or tapestry
hung behind the single table. The man to the left is probably the
steward, or the superior of the hall; next to him is the cup-bearer serving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
the liquor; further to the right we have the carver cutting the meat; and
last of all the cook bringing in another dish. The table is laid much in
the same manner in our third example, cut <a href="#n112">No. 112</a>. We have again
the cups and the bread, the latter in round cakes; in our second example
they are marked with crosses, as in the Anglo-Saxon illuminations; but
there are no forks, or even spoons, which, of course, were used for
pottage and soups, and were perhaps brought on and taken off with
them. All the guests seem to be ready to use their fingers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n112" src="images/i_n112.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 112. A Royal Feast.</i></p></div>

<p>There was much formality and ceremony observed in filling and presenting
the cup, and it required long instruction to make the young cup-bearer
perfect in his duties. In our cut <a href="#n111">No. 111</a>, it will be observed that
the carver holds the meat with his fingers while he cuts it. This is in
exact accordance with the rules given in the ancient ‚ÄúBoke of Kervyng,‚Äù
where this officer is told, ‚ÄúSet never on fyshe, flesche, beest, ne fowle,
more than two fyngers and a thombe.‚Äù It will be observed also that in
none of these pictures have the guests any plates; they seem to have
eaten with their hands, and thrown the refuse on the table. We know
also that they often threw the fragments on the floor, where they were
eaten up by cats and dogs, which were admitted into the hall without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
restriction of number. In the ‚ÄúBoke of Curtasye,‚Äù already mentioned,
it is blamed as a mark of bad breeding to play with the cats and dogs
while seated at table&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Whereso thou sitt at mete in borde</i> (at table),<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>For yf thou stroke cat other dogge,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Thou art lyke an ape teyghed with a clogge</i>.<br /></span>
</span></span>

Some of these directions for behaviour are very droll, and show no great
refinement of manners. A guest at table is recommended to keep his
nails clean, for fear his fellow next him should be disgusted&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Loke thy naylys ben clene in blythe,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Lest thy felaghe lothe therwyth.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

He is cautioned against spitting on the table&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>If thou spit on the borde or elles opone,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Thou shalle be holden an uncurtayse mon.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

When he blows his nose with his hand (handkerchiefs were not, it appears,
in use), he is told to wipe his hand on his skirt or on his tippet&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Yf thy nose thou clense, as may befalle,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Loke thy honde thou clense withalle,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Prively with skyrt do hit away,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or ellis thurgh thi tepet that is so gay.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

He is not to pick his teeth with his knife, or with a straw or stick, nor
to clean them with the table-cloth; and, if he sits by a gentleman, he is
to take care he does not put his knee under the other‚Äôs thigh!</p>

<p>The cleanliness of the white table-cloth seems to have been a matter
of pride; and to judge by the illuminations great care seems to have
been taken to place it neatly and smoothly on the table, and to arrange
tastefully the part which hung down at the sides. Generally speaking,
the service on the table in these illuminations appears to be very simple,
consisting of the cups, stands for the dishes of meat (messes, as they were
called) brought by the cook, the knives, sometimes spoons for soup and
liquids, and bread. Ostentatious ornament is not often introduced, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
it was perhaps only used at the tables of princes and of the more powerful
nobles. Of these ornaments, one of the most remarkable was the nef, or
ship&mdash;a vessel, generally of silver, which contained the salt-cellar, towel,
&amp;c., of the prince, or great lord, on whose table it was brought with great
ceremony. It was in the form of a ship,
raised on a stand, and on one end it had
some figure, such as a serpent, or castle,
perhaps an emblem or badge chosen by its
possessor. Our cut <a href="#n113">No. 113</a>, taken from a
manuscript in the French National Library,
represents the nef placed on the table.
The badge or emblem at the end appears
to be a bird.</p>

<p>Our forefathers seem to have remained
a tolerably long time at table, the pleasures
of which were by no means despised.
Indeed, to judge by the sermons and satires
of the middle ages, gluttony seems to have
been a very prevalent vice among the clergy as well as the laity; and
however miserably the lower classes lived, the tables of the rich were
loaded with every delicacy that could be procured. The monks were
proverbially <i>bons vivants</i>; and their failings in this respect are not unfrequently
satirised in the illuminated ornaments
of the medi√¶val manuscripts. We
have an example in our cut <a href="#n114">No. 114</a>, taken
from a manuscript of the fourteenth century
in the Arundel Collection in the
British Museum (<a href="#n91">No. 91</a>); a monk is
regaling himself on the sly, apparently
upon dainty tarts or patties, while the
dish is held up by a little cloven-footed imp who seems to enjoy the
spirit of the thing, quite as much as the other enjoys the substance. Our
next cut (<a href="#n115">No. 115</a>) is taken from another manuscript in the British Museum
of the same date (MS. Sloane, No. 2435), and forms an appropriate companion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
to the other. The monk here holds the office of cellarer, and is
taking advantage of it to console himself on the sly.</p>

<p>When the last course of the dinner had been served, the ewer and
his companion again carried round the water and towel, and each guest
washed. The tables were then cleared and the
cloths withdrawn, but the drinking continued.
The minstrels were now introduced. To judge
by the illuminations, the most common musical
attendant on such occasions was a harper, who
repeated romances and told stories, accompanying
them with his instrument. In one of
our cuts of a dinner party (<a href="#n112">No. 112</a>), given in
a former page, we see the harper, apparently
a blind man, led by his dog, introduced into
the hall while the guests are still occupied with
their repast. We frequently find a harper thus
introduced, who is sometimes represented as sitting upon the floor, as in the
accompanying illustration (<a href="#n116">No. 116</a>) from the MS. Reg. 2 B. vii. fol. 71, v<sup>o</sup>.
Another similar representation occurs at folio 203, v<sup>o</sup> of the same MS.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 116. The Harper in the Hall.</i></p></div>

<p>The barons and knights themselves, and their ladies, did not disdain
to learn the harper‚Äôs craft; and Gower, in his ‚ÄúConfessio Amantis,‚Äù
describes a scene in which a princess plays the harp at table. Appolinus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
is dining in the hall of king Pentapolin, with the king and queen and
their fair daughter, and all his lords, when, reminded by the scene of the
royal estate from which he is fallen, he sorrowed and took no meat;
therefore the king, sympathising with him, bade his daughter take her
harp and do all that she could to enliven that ‚Äúsorry man:‚Äù&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

proficient, and</p>

<p>The minstrels, or jougleurs, formed a very important class of society in
the middle ages, and no festival was considered as complete without their
presence. They travelled singly or in parties, not only from house to
house, but from country to country, and they generally brought with
them, to amuse and please their hearers, the last new song, or the last
new tale. When any great festival was announced, there was sure to be
a general gathering of minstrels from all quarters, and as they possessed
many methods of entertaining, for they joined the profession of mountebank,
posture-master, and conjurer with that of music and story-telling,
they were always welcome. No sooner, therefore, was the business of
eating done, than the jougleur or jougleurs were brought forward, and
sometimes, when the guests were in a more serious humour, they chanted
the old romances of chivalry; at other times they repeated satirical
poems, or party songs, according to the feelings or humour of those who
were listening to them, or told love tales or scandalous anecdotes, or
drolleries, accompanying them with acting, and intermingling them with
performances of various kinds. The hall was proverbially the place for
mirth, and as merriment of a coarse description suited the medi√¶val taste, the
stories and performances of the jougleurs were often of an obscene character,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
even in the presence of the ladies. In the illuminated manuscripts,
the minstrel is most commonly a harper, perhaps because these illuminations
are usually found in the old romances of chivalry where the harper
generally acts an important part, for the minstrels were not unfrequently
employed in messages and intrigues. In general
the harp is wrapped in some sort of drapery, as
represented in our cut <a href="#n117">No. 117</a>, taken from a MS.
in the National Library of Paris, which was perhaps
the bag in which the minstrel carried it, and
may have been attached to the bottom of the
instrument. The accompanying scene of minstrelsy
is taken from a manuscript of the romance
of Guyron le Courtois in the French National
Library, No. 6976.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n118" src="images/i_n118.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 118. Minstrelsy.</i></p></div>

<p>The dinner was always accompanied by music,
and itinerant minstrels, mountebanks, and performers of all descriptions,
were allowed free access to the hall to amuse the guests by their performances.
These were intermixed with dancing and tumbling, and
often with exhibitions of a very gross character, which, however, amid
the looseness of medi√¶val manners, appear to have excited no disgust.
These practices are curiously illustrated in some of the medi√¶val illuminations.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
In the account of the death of John the Baptist, as given in
the gospels (Matthew xiv. 6, and Mark vi. 21), we are told, that at the
feast given by Herod on his birthday, his daughter Herodias came into
the feasting-hall, and (according to our English version) danced before
him and his guests. The Latin vulgate has <i>saltasset</i>, which is equivalent
to the English word but the medi√¶val writers took the lady‚Äôs performances
to be those of a regular wandering jougleur; and in two illuminated
manuscripts of the early part of the fourteenth century, in the
British Museum, she is pictured as performing tricks very similar to
those exhibited by the modern beggar-boys in our streets. In the first of
these (<a href="#n119">No. 119</a>), taken from MS. Reg. 2 B. vii., the princess is supporting
herself upon her hands with her legs in the air, to the evident
admiration of the king, though the guests seem to be paying less
attention to her feats of activity. In the second (<a href="#n120">No. 120</a>), from the
Harleian MS. No. 1527, she is represented in a similar position, but
more evidently making a somersault. She is here accompanied by a
female attendant, who expresses no less delight at her skill than the king
and his guests.</p>

<p>It would appear from various accounts that it was not, unless perhaps
at an early period, the custom in France to sit long after dinner at table
drinking wine, as it certainly was in England, where, no doubt, the
practice was derived from the Anglo-Saxons. Numerous allusions might
be pointed out, which show how much our Anglo-Saxon forefathers were
addicted to this practice of sitting in their halls and drinking during the
latter part of their day; and it was then that they listened to the
minstrel‚Äôs song, told stories of their own feats and adventures, and made
proof of their powers in hard drinking. From some of these allusions,
which we have quoted in an earlier chapter, it is equally clear, that these
drinking-bouts often ended in sanguinary, and not unfrequently in fatal,
brawls. Such scenes of discord in the hall occur also in the early French
metrical romances, but they take place usually at the beginning of dinner,
when the guests are taking their places, or during the meal. In ‚ÄúParise
la Duchesse,‚Äù a scene of this description occurs, in which the great feudal
barons and knights fight with the provisions which had been served at
the tables: ‚ÄúThere,‚Äù says the poet, ‚Äúyou might see them throw cheeses,
and quartern-loaves, and great pieces of flesh, and great steel knives‚Äù&mdash;

In ‚ÄúGarin le Loherain‚Äù (vol. ii. p. 17), at a feast at which the emperor
and his empress were present, a fight commences between the two great
baronial parties who were their guests, by a chief of one party striking
one of the other party with a goblet; the cooks are brought out of the
kitchen to take part in it, with their pestles, ladles, and pot-hooks, led by
duke Begon, who had seized a spit, full of birds, as the weapon which
came first to hand; and the contest is not appeased until many are killed
and wounded.</p>

<p>The preceding remarks, of course, apply chiefly to the tables of the
prince, the noble, and the wealthy gentleman, where alone this degree
of profusion and of ceremony reigned; and to those of the monastic
houses and of the higher clergy, where, if possible, the luxury even of
princes was overpassed. The examples of clerical and monastic extravagance
in feasting are so numerous, that I will not venture on this occasion
to enter upon them any further. All recorded facts would lead us to
conclude, that the ordinary course of living of the monks was much more
luxurious than that of the clerical lords of the land, who, indeed, seem to
have lived, on ordinary occasions, with some degree of simplicity, except
that the great number of people who dined at their expense, required a
very large quantity of provisions. Even men of rank, when dining alone,
or hastily, are described as being satisfied with a very limited variety of
food. In the romance of ‚ÄúGarin,‚Äù when Rigaud, one of the barons of
‚ÄúGarin‚Äôs‚Äù party, arrives at court with important news, and very hungry,
the empress orders him to be served with a large vessel of wine (explained
by a various reading to be equivalent to a pot), four loaves (the loaves
appear usually to have been small), and a roasted peacock&mdash;

In a pane of painted glass in the possession of Dr. Henry Johnson, of
Shrewsbury, of Flemish workmanship of about the beginning of the
sixteenth century, and representing the story of the Prodigal Son, the
Prodigal is seated at table with a party of dissolute women, feasting upon
a pasty. It is reproduced in our cut <a href="#n121">No. 121</a>. They appear to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
only one drinking-cup among them, but the wine is served from a very
rich goblet. We cannot, however, always judge the character of a feast
by the articles placed on the table by the medi√¶val illuminators, for they
were in the constant habit of drawing things conventionally, and they
seem to have found a difficulty&mdash;perhaps in consequence of their ignorance
of perspective&mdash;in representing a crowded table. Our cut <a href="#n122">No. 122</a>,
on the following page, taken from MS. Reg. 10 E. iv., in which we
recognize again our old friend the holy-water clerc, represents a table
which is certainly very sparingly furnished, although the persons seated
at it seem to belong to a respectable class in society. Some cooked
articles, perhaps meat, on a stand, bread, a single knife to cut the provisions,
and one pot, probably of ale, from which they seem to have drunk
without the intervention of a glass, form the whole service.</p>

<p>We find allusions from time to time to the style of living of the class
in the country answering to our yeomanry, and of the <i>bourgeoisie</i> in the
towns, which appears to have been sufficiently plain. In the romance of
‚ÄúBerte‚Äù (p. 78), when Berte finds shelter at the house of the farmer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
Symon, they give her, for refreshment, a chicken and wine. In the
fabliau of the ‚Äú<i>Vilain mire</i>‚Äù (Barbazan, vol. iii. p. 3), the farmer, who
had saved money, and become tolerably rich, had no such luxuries as
salmon or partridge, but his provisions consisted only of bread and wine,
and fried eggs, and cheese in abundance&mdash;</p>

<p>A story in the celebrated collection of the Cent. Nouvelles Nouvelles
(Nouv. 83), composed soon after the middle of the fifteenth century,
gives us some notion of the store of provisions in the house of an ordinary
burgher. A worthy and pious <i>demoiselle</i>&mdash;that is, a woman of the respectable
class of <i>bourgeoisie</i>, who was, in this case, a widow&mdash;invited a monk
to dine with her, out of charity. They dined without other company,
and were served by a <i>chambri√®re</i> or maid-servant, and a man-servant or
valet. The course of meat, which was first placed on the table, consisted
of <i>por√©e</i>, or soup, bacon, pork tripes, and a roasted ox‚Äôs tongue. But the
demoiselle had miscalculated the voracity of her guest, for, before she had
made much progress in her <i>por√©e</i>, he had devoured everything on the
table, and left nothing but empty dishes. On seeing this, his hostess
ordered her servants to put on the table a piece of good salt beef, and a
large piece of choice mutton; but he ate these also, to her no little
astonishment, and she was obliged to send for a fine ham, which had
been cooked the day before, and which appears to have been all the meat
left in the house. The monk devoured this, and left nothing but the
bone. The course which would have followed the first service was then
laid on the table, consisting of a ‚Äúvery fine fat cheese,‚Äù and a dish well
furnished with tarts, apples, and cheese, which also quickly followed the
meat. It appears from this story that the ordinary dinner of a respectable
burgher consisted of a soup, and two or three plain dishes of meat,
followed by cheese, pastry, and fruit. An illumination, illustrative of
another tale in this collection, in the unique manuscript preserved in the
Hunterian Library, at Glasgow, and copied in the annexed cut (<a href="#n123">No. 123</a>),
represents a dinner-table of an ordinary person of this class of society,
which is not over largely furnished. We see only bread in the middle,
what appears to be intended for a ham at one end, and at the other a
dish, perhaps of cakes or tarts. The lower classes lived, of course, much
more meanly than the others; but we have fewer allusions to them in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
the earlier medi√¶val literature, as they were looked upon as a class hardly
worth describing. This class was, no doubt, much more miserable in
France than in England. A French moral poem of the fourteenth
century, entitled ‚Äú<i>Le Chemin de Pauvret√© et de Richesse</i>,‚Äù represents the
poor labourers as having no other food than bread, garlic, and salt, with
water to drink:&mdash;</p>

<p>As I have said, the dresser (<i>dressoir</i>) or cupboard was the only important
article of furniture in the hall, besides the tables and benches. It
was a mere cupboard for the plate, and had generally steps to enable the
servants to reach the articles that were placed high up in it, but it is
rarely represented in pictured manuscripts before the fifteenth century,
when the illuminators began to introduce more detail into their works.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
The reader may form a notion of its contents, from the list of the service
of plate given by Edward I. of England to his daughter Margaret, after
her marriage with the duke of Brabant; it consisted of forty-six silver
cups with feet, for drinking; six wine pitchers, four ewers for water, four
basins with gilt escutcheons, six great silver dishes for entremets; one
hundred and twenty smaller dishes; a hundred and twenty salts; one
gilt salt, for her own use; seventy-two spoons; and three silver spice-plates
with a spice-spoon.</p>

<p>The dresser, as well as all the furniture of the hall, was in the care of
the groom; it was his business to lay them out, and to take them away
again. It appears to have been the usual custom to take away the boards
and tressels (forming the tables) at the same time as the cloth. The
company remained seated on the benches, and the drinking-cups were
handed round to them. So tells us the ‚ÄúBoke of Curtasye‚Äù&mdash;</p>

NORMAN TROUVERE, MENESTREL, AND JOUGLEUR.&mdash;THEIR CONDITION.&mdash;RUTEBEUF.&mdash;DIFFERENT
MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN USE
AMONG THE MINSTRELS.&mdash;THE BEVERLEY MINSTRELS.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> minstrel acted so very prominent a part in the household and
domestic arrangements during the middle ages, that a volume on
the history of domestic manners would be incomplete without some more
detailed account of his profession than the slight and occasional notices
given in the preceding pages.</p>

<p>Our information relating to the Anglo-Saxon minstrel is very imperfect.
He had two names&mdash;<i>scop</i>, which meant literally a ‚Äúmaker,‚Äù and
belonged probably to the primitive bard or poet; and <i>glig-man</i>, or <i>gleo-man</i>,
the modern gleeman, which signifies literally a man who furnished
joy or pleasure, and appears to have had a more comprehensive application,
which included all professional performers for other people‚Äôs
amusement. In Beowulf (l. 180), the ‚Äúsong of the bard‚Äù (<i>sang scopes</i>)
is accompanied by the sound of the harp (<i>hearpan sw√©g</i>); and it is
probable that the harp was the special instrument of the old Saxon bard,
who chanted the mythic and heroic poems of the race. The gleemen
played on a variety of instruments, and they also exhibited a variety of
other performances for the amusement of the hearers or spectators. In
our engraving from an Anglo-Saxon illumination (p. 37), one of the
gleemen is tossing knives and balls, which seems to have been considered
a favourite exhibition of skill down to a much later period. The early
English Rule of Nuns (printed by the Camden Society) says of the
wrathful man, that ‚Äúhe skirmishes before the devil with knives, and he
is his knife-tosser, and plays with swords, and balances them upon his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
tongue by the sharp point.‚Äù In the Life of Hereward, the gleeman
(whose name is there translated by <i>joculator</i>) is represented as conciliating
the favour of the new Norman lords by mimicking the unrefined manners
of the Saxons, and throwing upon them indecent jests and reproaches.
But, in the later Anglo-Saxon period at least, the words <i>scop</i> and <i>gle√≥man</i>
appear to have been considered as equivalent; for, in another hall-scene
in Beowulf, where the scop performs his craft, we are told that&mdash;

<span class="table">

<span class="tcell"><i>The lay was sung,</i></span>

<span class="tcell"><i>the bench-noise became loud.</i>
<span class="author">&mdash;Beowulf, l. 2323.</span></span>
</span></span>

There is here evidently an intimation of merrier songs than those sung
by the <i>scop</i>, and whatever his performances were, they drew a louder
welcome. And in a fragment of another romance which has come down
to us, the gleeman Widseth bears witness to the wandering character of
his class, and enumerates in a long list the various courts of different
chiefs and peoples which he had visited. We learn, also, that among
the Anglo-Saxons there were gleemen attached to the courts or households
of the kings and great chieftains. Under Edward the Confessor,
as we learn from the Domesday Survey, Berdic, the king‚Äôs <i>joculator</i>,
possessed three villas in Gloucestershire.</p>

<p>On the continent, when we first become acquainted with the history
of the popular literature, we find the minstrels, the representatives of the
ancient bards, appearing as the composers and chanters of the poems
which told the stories of the old heroes of romance, and they seem also
to have been accompanied usually with the harp, or with some other
stringed instrument. They speak of themselves, in these poems, as
wandering about from castle to castle, wherever any feasting was going
on, as being everywhere welcome, and as depending upon the liberality
either of the lord of the feast, or of the guests, for their living. Occasional
complaints would lead us to suppose that this liberality was not
always great, and the poems themselves contain formules of begging
appeals, which are not very dignified or delicate. Thus, in the romance
of ‚ÄúGui de Bourgogne,‚Äù the minstrel interrupts his narrative, to inform his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
hearers that ‚ÄúWhoever wishes to hear any more of this poem, must
make haste to open his purse, for it is now high time that he give me
something‚Äù&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Qui or voldra chan√ßon o√Ør et escouter,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Si voist isnelement sa boursse desfermer,</i><br /></span>

<span class="author">&mdash;Gui de Bourgogne, l. 4136.<br /></span>
</span></span>

In like manner, in the romance of ‚ÄúHuon de Bordeaux,‚Äù the minstrel,
after having recited nearly five thousand lines, makes his excuse for
discontinuing until another day. He reminds his auditors that it is near
vespers, and that he is weary, and invites them to return next day after
dinner, begging each of them to bring with him a <i>maille</i>, or halfpenny,
and complaining of the meanness of those who were accustomed to give
so small a coin as the <i>poitivine</i> ‚Äúto the courteous minstrel.‚Äù The
minstrel seems to have calculated that this hint might not be sufficient,
and that they would require being reminded of it, for, after some two or
three hundred lines of the next day‚Äôs recital, he introduces another
formule of appeal to the purses of his hearers. ‚ÄúTake notice,‚Äù he goes
on to say, ‚Äúas may God give me health, I will immediately put a stop to
my song; ... and I at once excommunicate all those who shall not
visit their purses in order to give something to my wife‚Äù&mdash;

These minstrels, too, display great jealousy of one another, and especially
of what they term the new minstrels, exclaiming against the decadence
of the profession.</p>

<p>It would appear, indeed, that these French minstrels, the poets by
profession, who now become known to us by the name of <i>trouv√®res</i>, or
inventors (in the language of the south of France, <i>trobadors</i>), held a
position towards the <i>jougleurs</i>, or <i>jogleurs</i><a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> (from the Latin <i>joculatores</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
and this again from <i>jocus</i>, game), which the Anglo-Saxon <i>scop</i> held
towards the gleeman. Though the mass of the minstrels did get their
living as itinerant songsters, they might be respectable, and sometimes
there was a man of high rank who became a minstrel for his pleasure;
but the jougleurs, as a body, belonged to the lowest and most degraded
class of medi√¶val society, that of the ribalds or letchers, and the more
respectable minstrels of former days were probably falling gradually into
their ranks. It was the class which abandoned itself without reserve to
the mere amusement and pleasure of the aristocracy, and it seems to have
been greatly increased by the Crusades, when the jougleurs of the west
were brought into relations with those of the east, and learnt a multitude
of new ways of exciting attention and making mirth, of which they were
previously ignorant. The jougleurs had now become, in addition to their
older accomplishments, magicians and conjurers, and wonderfully skilled
in every description of sleight of hand, and it is from these qualities that
we have derived the modern signification of the word <i>juggler</i>. They
had also adopted the profession of the eastern story-tellers, as well as
their stories, which, however, they turned into verse; and they brought
into the west many other exhibitions which did not tend to raise the
standard of western morals.</p>

<p>The character of the minstrels, or jougleurs, their wandering life, and
the ease with which they were admitted everywhere, caused them to be
employed extensively as spies, and as bearers of secret news, and led
people to adopt the disguise of a minstrel, as one which enabled them to
pass through difficulties unobserved and unchallenged. In the story of
Eustace the monk, when Eustace sought to escape from England, to
avoid the pursuit of king John, he took a fiddle and a bow (a fiddlestick),
and dressed himself as a minstrel, and in this garb he arrived at the coast,
and, finding a merchant ready to sail, entered the ship with him. But
the steersman, who did not recognise the minstrel as one of the passengers,
ordered him out. Eustace expostulated, represented that he was a minstrel,
and, after some dispute, the steersman, who seems to have had some
suspicions either of his disguise or of his skill, concluded by putting the
question, ‚ÄúAt all events, if thou knowest any song, friend, let us have it.‚Äù
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
The monk was not skilled in singing, but he replied boldly, ‚ÄúKnow
I one? Yea! of Agoulant, and Aymon, or of Blonchadin, or of Florence
of Rome (these were all early metrical romances); there is not a song in
the whole world but I know it. I should be delighted, no doubt, to
afford you amusement; but, in truth, the sea frightens me so much at
present, that I could not sing a song worth hearing.‚Äù He was allowed
to pass. Some of those who adopted the disguise of the jougleur were
better able to sustain it, and minstrelsy became considered as a polite
accomplishment, perhaps partly on account of its utility. There is, in
the history of the Fitz-Warines, a remarkable character of this description
named John de Raunpaygne. Fulke Fitz-Warine had formed a design
against his great enemy, Moris Fitz-Roger, and he established himself,
with his fellow outlaws, in the forest near Whittington, in Shropshire, to
watch him. Fulke then called to him John de Raunpaygne. ‚ÄúJohn,‚Äù
said he, ‚Äúyou know enough of minstrelsy and joglery; dare you go to
Whittington, and play before Moris Fitz-Roger, and spy how things are
going on?‚Äù ‚ÄúYea,‚Äù said John. He crushed a herb, and put it in his
mouth, and his face began immediately to swell, and became so discoloured,
that his own companions hardly knew him; and he dressed
himself in poor clothes, and ‚Äútook his box with his instruments of joglery
and a great staff in his hand;‚Äù and thus he went to Whittington, and
presented himself at the castle, and said that he was a jogeleur. The
porter carried him to Sir Moris, who received him well, inquired in the
first place for news, and receiving intelligence which pleased him (it was
designedly false), he gave the minstrel a valuable silver cup as a reward.
Now, ‚ÄúJohn de Raunpaygne was very ill-favoured in face and body, and
on this account the ribalds of the household made game of him, and
treated him roughly, and pulled him by his hair and by his feet. John
raised his staff, and struck a ribald on the head, that his brain flew into
the middle of the place. ‚ÄòWretched ribald,‚Äô said the lord, ‚Äòwhat hast
thou done?‚Äô ‚ÄòSir,‚Äô said he, ‚Äòfor God‚Äôs mercy, I cannot help it; I have
a disease which is very grievous, which you may see by my swollen face.
And this disease takes entire possession of me at certain hours of the day,
when I have no power to govern myself.‚Äô Moris swore a great oath,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
that if it were not for the news he had brought, he would have his head
cut off immediately. The jogeleur hastened his departure, for the time
he remained there seemed very long.‚Äù The result of this adventure was
the attack upon and slaughter of Moris Fitz-Roger by Fulk Fitz-Warine.
Some time after this, Fulk Fitz-Warine, having recovered his castle of
Whittington, was lamenting over the loss of his friend, Sir Audulf de
Bracy, who had fallen into the hands of king John‚Äôs emissaries, and was
a prisoner in Shrewsbury castle, where king John had come to make his
temporary residence, and again asked the aid of John de Raunpaygne,
who promised to make a visit to the king. ‚ÄúJohn de Raunpaygne knew
enough of tabor, harp, fiddle, citole, and joglery; and he attired himself
very richly, like an earl or baron, and he caused his hair and all his body
to be entirely dyed as black as jet, so that nothing was white except his
teeth. And he hung round his neck a very handsome tabor, and then,
mounting a handsome palfrey, rode through the town of Shrewsbury to
the gate of the castle; and by many a one was he looked at. John came
before the king, and placed himself on his knees, and saluted the king
very courteously. The king returned his salutation, and asked him
whence he came. ‚ÄòSire,‚Äô said he, ‚ÄòI am an Ethiopian minstrel, born in
Ethiopia.‚Äô Said the king, ‚ÄòAre all the people in your land of your
colour?‚Äô ‚ÄòYea, my lord, man and woman.‚Äô ... John, during the
day, made great minstrelsy of tabor and other instruments. When the
king was gone to bed, Sir Henry de Audeley sent for the black minstrel,
and led him into his chamber. And they made great melody; and when
Sir Henry had drunk well, then he said to a valet, ‚ÄòGo and fetch Sir
Audulf de Bracy, whom the king will put to death to-morrow; for he
shall have a good night of it before his death.‚Äô The valet soon brought
Sir Audulf into the chamber. Then they talked and played. John
commenced a song which Sir Audulf used to sing; Sir Audulf raised his
head, looked at him full in the face, and with great difficulty recognised
him. Sir Henry asked for some drink; John was very serviceable,
jumped nimbly on his feet, and served the cup before them all. John
was sly, he threw a powder into the cup, which nobody perceived, for he
was a good jogeleur, and all who drunk became so sleepy that, soon after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
drinking, they lay down and fell asleep. John de Raunpaygne and
Sir Audulf de Bracy took the opportunity for making their escape. We
have here a mysterious intimation of the fact that the minstrel was
employed also in dark deeds of poisoning. Still later on in the story of
Fulk Fitz-Warine, the hero himself goes to a tournament in France in
disguise, and John de Raunpaygne resumes his old character of a jougleur.‚Äù
‚ÄúJohn,‚Äù says the narrative, ‚Äúwas very richly attired, and well mounted,
and he had a very rich tabor, and he struck the tabor at the entry to
the lifts, that the hills and valleys rebounded, and the horses became
joyful.‚Äù</p>

<p>All these anecdotes reveal to us minstrels who were perfectly free,
and wandered from place to place at will; but there were others who
were retained by and in the regular employ of individuals. The king
had his minstrels, and so most of the barons had their household minstrels.
In one of the medi√¶val Latin stories, current in this country
probably as early as the thirteenth century, we are told that a jougleur
(<i>mimus</i> he is called in the Latin, a word used at this time as synonymous
with <i>joculator</i>) presented himself at the gate of a certain lord to enter
the hall and eat (for the table in those days was rarely refused to a minstrel),
but he was stopped by the porter, who asked him to what lord he
was attached, evidently thinking, as was thought some three centuries
later, that the treatment merited by the servant depended on the quality
of the master. The minstrel replied that his master was God. When
the porter communicated this response to his churlish lord, or equally
churlish steward, they replied that if he had no other lord, he should not
be admitted there. When the jougleur heard this, he said that he was
the devil‚Äôs own servant; whereupon he was received joyfully, ‚Äúbecause
he was a good fellow‚Äù (<i>quia bonus socius erat</i>). The records of the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries contain many entries of payments to
the king‚Äôs minstrels, and the names of some of them are preserved. On
great festivals at the king‚Äôs court, minstrels came to seek employment
from every part of the world which acknowledged the reign of feudalism.
Four hundred and twenty-six minstrels were present at the marriage
festivities of the princess Margaret, daughter of Edward I.; and several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
hundred played before the same monarch at the Whitsuntide of 1306.
This affluence of minstrels gave rise to the practice of building a large
music-gallery at one end of the medi√¶val hall, which seems to have been
introduced in the fourteenth century. At this time minstrels were sometimes
employed for very singular purposes, such as for soothing the king
when undergoing a disagreeable operation. We learn from the wardrobe
accounts that, in the twenty-fifth year of the reign of Edward I.
(<small>A.D.</small> 1297) twenty shillings, or about fifteen pounds in modern money,
was given to the minstrel of Sir John Maltravers as a reward for performing
before the king while he was bled.</p>

<p>The king‚Äôs minstrels, and those of the great lords, were very well
paid, but the great mass of the profession, who depended only on what
they obtained in gifts at each particular feast, which they recklessly
squandered away as soon as they got it, lived a hard as it was a vagabond
life. The king‚Äôs minstrels, in the fourteenth century in England, received
from sixpence to sevenpence halfpenny a day, that is from seven shillings
and sixpence to nine shillings and fourpence halfpenny, during the whole
year. On the other hand, Colin Muset, one of the best of the French
song-writers of the thirteenth century, complains of the want of liberality
shown to him by the great baron before whom he had played on the viol
in his hostel, and who had given him nothing, not even his wages:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sire quens, j‚Äôai viel√©</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Devant vos en vostre ostel;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Si ne m‚Äôavez riens donn√©,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ne mes gages acquiter.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

And he laments that he is obliged to go home in poverty, because his
wife always received him ill when he returned to her with an empty
purse, whereas, when he carried back his <i>malle</i> well stuffed, he was
covered with caresses by his whole family. The French poet Rutebeuf,
whose works have been collected and published by M. Jubinal, may be
considered as the type of the better class of minstrels at this period, and
he has become an object of especial interest to us in consequence of the
number of his shorter effusions which describe his own position in life.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
The first piece in the collection has for its subject his own poverty. He
complains of being reduced to such distress, that he had been obliged for
some time to live upon the generosity of his friends; that people no
longer showed any liberality to poor minstrels; that he was perishing
with cold and hunger; and that he had no other bed but the bare straw.
In another poem, entitled Rutebeuf‚Äôs Marriage, he informs us that his
privations were made more painful by the circumstance of his having a
shrew for his wife. In a third he laments over the loss of the sight of
his right eye, and informs us that, among other misfortunes, his wife had
just been delivered of a child, and his horse had broke its leg, so that,
while he had no means of supporting a nurse for the former, the latter
accident had deprived him of the power of going to any distance to exercise
his minstrelsy craft. Rutebeuf repeats his laments on his extreme
poverty in several other pieces, and they have an echo in those of other
minstrels of his age. We find, in fact, in the verse-writers of the latter
half of the thirteenth century, and in some of those of the fourteenth,
a general complaint of the neglect of the minstrels, and of the degeneracy
of minstrelsy. In a poem against the growing taste for the tabor, printed
in M. Jubinal‚Äôs volume, entitled ‚ÄúJougleurs et Trouv√®res,‚Äù the low state
into which the minstrels‚Äô art had fallen is ascribed to a growing love for
instruments of an undignified character, such as the tabor, which is said
to have been brought to us from the Arabs, and the pipe. If an ignorant
shepherd from the field, says the writer of this poem, but play on the tabor
and pipe, he becomes more popular than the man who plays on the viol
ever so well&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Quar s‚Äôuns bergiers de chans tabore et chalemele,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Plus tost est apel√© que cil qui bien viele.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

Everybody followed the tabor, he says, and the good minstrels were no
longer in vogue, though their fiddles were so much superior to the flutes,
and flajolets (<i>flajols</i>), and tabors of the others. He consoles himself,
however, with the reflection that the holy Virgin Mary never loved the
tabor, and that no such vulgar instrument was admitted at her wedding;

nobody. No rich man ought to love the sound of a tabor, which is bad

<p class="caption"><i>No. 124. An Organ Player.</i></p></div>

<p>The musical instruments used by the medi√¶val gleemen and minstrels
form in themselves a not uninteresting subject. Those enumerated
in the Anglo-Saxon vocabularies are the harp (<i>hearpe</i>, <i>cithara</i>), the
<i>byme</i>, or trumpet, the pipe, ‚Äúor whistle,‚Äù the
<i>fithele</i>, viol, or fiddle, the horn, and the trumpet,
the latter of which was called in Anglo-Saxon
<i>truth</i> and <i>s√¶rga</i>. To these we must certainly add
a few others, for the drum or tabor seems to have
been in use among them under some form, as
well as the cymbal, hand-bells, lyre struck by a
plectrum, and the organ, which latter was already
the favourite church instrument. A portable organ
was in use in the middle ages, of which we give a
figure (<a href="#n124">No. 124</a>), from a manuscript in the British
Museum of the earlier part of the fourteenth century
(MS. Reg. 14 E. iii.). This hand-organ was
known also by the name of the dulcimer. It occurs
again in the following group (<a href="#n125">No. 125</a>), taken from
a manuscript of the fourteenth century in the British
Museum (MS. Addit. No. 10,293), where the performer
on the dulcimer is accompanied by two other minstrels, one playing
on the bagpipe, the other on the viol or fiddle.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 126. David and his Musicians.</i></p></div>

<p>Each of the figures in this group is dressed in a costume so different
from the others that one might almost suppose them engaged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
in a masquerade, and they seem to discountenance the notion that the
minstrels were in the habit of wearing any dress peculiar to their class.
In this respect, their testimony seems to be confirmed by the circumstance
that minstrels are mentioned sometimes as wearing the dresses which
have been given them, among other gifts, as a reward for their performances.
The illuminated letter here introduced (<a href="#n126">No. 126</a>), which is taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
from a manuscript of the thirteenth century in the British Museum
(MS. Harl. No. 5102), represents king David singing his psalms to the
harp, while three musicians accompany him. The first, who sits beside
him, is playing on the shalm or psaltery, which is frequently figured in
the illuminations of manuscripts. One of the two upper figures is playing
on bells, which also is a description of music often represented in the
illuminations of different periods; and the other is blowing the horn.
These are all instruments of solemn and ecclesiastical music. In the next
cut (<a href="#n127">No. 127</a>), taken from a manuscript of the fourteenth century (MS.
Reg. 2 B. vii.), the shalm is placed in the hands of a nun, while a friar is
performing on a rather singularly shaped cittern, or lute.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 129. An Angel Playing on the Shalm.</i></p></div>

<p>In other manuscripts we find the ordinary musical instruments placed
in the hands of the angels; as in the early fourteenth century MS. Reg.
2 B. vii., in a representation (copied in our cut <a href="#n128">No. 128</a>) of the creation
with the morning stars singing together, and all the sons of God shouting
for joy, an angelic choir are making melody on the trumpet, fiddle,
cittern, shalm, and harp. There is another choir of angels at p. 168 of
the same MS., with two citterns and two shalms, a fiddle and a trumpet.
Similar representations occur in the choirs of churches. In the bosses of
the ceiling of Tewkesbury abbey church we see angels playing the
cittern (with a plectrum), the harp (with its cover seen enveloping the
lower half of the instrument), and the cymbals. In the choir of Lincoln
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
cathedral, some of the series of angels which fill the spandrels of its
arcades, and which have given to it the name of the angel choir, are
playing instruments, such as the trumpet, double pipe, pipe and tabret, dulcimer,
viol and harp, as if to represent the heavenly choir
attuning their praises in harmony with the human choir
below:&mdash;‚Äútherefore with angels and archangels, and with
all the company of heaven, we laud and magnify thy
glorious name.‚Äù We will introduce here another drawing
of an angelic minstrel (<a href="#n129">No. 129</a>), playing a shalm, from
the Royal MS. 14 E. iii.; others occur at folio 1 of the
same MS. It has been suggested that the band of village
musicians with flute, violin, clarionet, and bass-viol, whom
most of us have seen occupying the singing-gallery of some
country church, are probably not inaccurate representatives
of the band of minstrels who occupied the rood-lofts
in medi√¶val times. In this period of the middle ages,
indeed, music seems to have had a great charm for all
classes of society, and each class appears in turn in the
minstrel character in the illuminations of the manuscripts.
Even the shepherds, throughout the middle ages, seem
to have been musical, like the swains of Theocritus or
Virgil; for we constantly find them represented playing
upon instruments; and in confirmation we give a couple of goatherds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
(<a href="#n130">No. 130</a>), from MS. Reg. 2 B. vii. fol. 83, of early fourteenth century
date: they are playing on the pipe and horn. But, besides these instruments,
the bagpipe was also a rustic instrument: there is a shepherd
playing upon one on folio 112 of the same MS.
(given in our cut <a href="#n131">No. 131</a>): and again, in the early
fourteenth century MS. Reg. 2 B. vi., on the
reverse of folio 8, is a group of shepherds, one of
whom plays a small pipe, and another the bagpipes.
Chaucer (in the ‚ÄúHouse of Fame‚Äù) mentions&mdash;

It is curious to find that even at so late a period as
the reign of queen Mary, they still officiated at
weddings and other merrymakings in their villages,
and even sometimes excited the jealousy of the professors of the joyous
science, as we have seen in the early French poem against
the taborers.</p>

<p>I give next (cut <a href="#n132">No. 132</a>) a representation of a female
minstrel playing the tambourine; it is also taken from a MS.
of the fourteenth century (MS. Reg. 2 B. vii. fol. 182).</p>

<p>The earliest instance yet met with of the modern-shaped
drum is contained in the Coronation Book of
Richard II., preserved in the Chapter-house. Westminster, and is represented
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
in the annexed cut (<a href="#n133">No. 133</a>). This medi√¶val drummer is clearly
intended to be playing on two drums at once; and, in considering their
forms and position, we must make some allowance for the medi√¶val
neglect of perspective.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 134. Blowing the Trumpet and Playing on the Cymbals.</i></p></div>

<p>In the medi√¶val vocabularies we find several lists of musical instruments
then best known. Thus John de Garlande, in the middle of the
thirteenth century, enumerates, as the minstrels who were to be seen in
the houses of the wealthy, individuals who performed on the instruments
which he terms in Latin, <i>lyra</i> (meaning the harp), <i>tibia</i> (the flute), <i>cornu</i>
(the horn), <i>vidula</i> (the fiddle), <i>sistrum</i> (the drum), <i>giga</i> (the gittern),
<i>symphonia</i> (a symphony), <i>psalterium</i> (the psaltery), <i>chorus</i>, <i>citola</i> (the
cittern), <i>tympanum</i> (the tabor), and <i>cymbala</i> (cymbals). The English glossaries
of the fifteenth century add to these the trumpet, the <i>ribibe</i> (a sort of
fiddle), organs, and the crowd. The forms of these instruments of various
periods will be found in the illustrations which have been given in the
course of the present chapter. It will be well perhaps to enumerate again
the most common; they are the harp, fiddle, cittern or lute, hand-organ
or dulcimer, the shalm or psaltery, the pipe and tabor, pipes of various
sizes played like clarionets, but called flutes, the double pipe, hand-bells,
trumpets and horns, bagpipes, tambourine, tabret, drum, and cymbals. We
give two further groups of figures in illustration of these instruments, both
taken from the Royal MS. so often quoted, 2 B. vii. In the first (<a href="#n134">No. 134</a>)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
we have a boy (apparently) playing the cymbals; and in the second (No.
135) an example of the double flute, which we have already seen in
Anglo-Saxon manuscripts (see before, pp. 35 and 65), and which appears to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
have been one of the musical instruments borrowed immediately from the
Romans. In conclusion of this subject we give a group of musical instruments
(<a href="#n136">No. 136</a>) from one of the illustrations of the celebrated book
entitled ‚ÄúDer Weise K√∂nig,‚Äù a work of the close of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 136. Musical Instruments.</i></p></div>

<p>The early commentator on the Dictionarius, or Vocabulary, of John
de Garlande, calls the musical instruments <i>instrumenta leccatorum</i>, (instruments
of the letchers or ribalds), and I have already stated that the
minstrels, or jougleurs, were considered as belonging generally to that
degraded class of society. In the vocabularies of the fifteenth century,
they are generally classed under the head of reprehensible or disgraceful
professions, along with ribalds, heretics, harlots, and so forth. It was the
same character which led them, a little later, to be proscribed in acts of
parliament, under the titles of rogues and vagabonds. In the older
poetry, too, they are often joined with disgraceful epithets. There is a
curious early metrical story, or fabliau, which was made, no doubt, to be
recited by the minstrels themselves, although it throws ridicule on their
profession; it is entitled <i>Les deux Troveors ribauz</i>, ‚Äúthe two ribald trouv√®res,‚Äù
and consists in a ludicrous dispute between them on their qualifications
as minstrels. My readers must not suppose that at this time the
reciters of poetry were a different or better class than those who performed
jugglery and low buffoonery&mdash;for, in this poem, either of the two
claimants to superiority boasts of his skill equally in possessing in his
memory completely, and being able to recite well, the early Chansons de
Geste, or Carlovingian romances, the later romances of chivalry, and
the fabliaux or metrical stories; in playing upon the most fashionable
musical instruments, such as the citole, the fiddle, and the <i>gigue</i> (gittern);
in performing extraordinary feats and in sleight of hand; and even in
making chaplets of flowers, and in acting as a spy or as a go-between in
love intrigues. No doubt there were minstrels who kept themselves
more respectable, but they were exceptions to the general character of
the class, and were chiefly men in the service of the king or of the great
barons. There appears also to have been, for a long time, a continued
attempt to raise minstrelsy to a respectable position, and out of this
attempt arose, in different places, companies and guilds. Of these, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
most remarkable of which we have any knowledge in this country, was
the ancient fraternity of minstrels of Beverley, in Yorkshire. When this
company originated is not known; but it was of some consideration and
wealth in the reign of Henry VI., when the church of St. Mary‚Äôs, in
that town, was built; for the minstrels gave a pillar to it, on the capital
of which a band of minstrels were sculptured. The cut below (<a href="#n137">No. 137</a>)
is copied from the engraving of this group, given in Carter‚Äôs ‚ÄúAncient
Painting and Sculpture.‚Äù The oldest existing document of the fraternity
is a copy of laws of the time of Philip and Mary, similar to those by
which all trade guilds were governed: their officers were an alderman
and two stewards or seers (<i>i. e.</i> searchers); and the only items in their
laws which throw any light upon the history or condition of the minstrels
are&mdash;one which requires that they should not take ‚Äúany new brother
except he be mynstrell to some man of honour or worship, or waite of
some towne corporate or other ancient town, or else of such honestye and
conyng (<i>knowledge</i>) as shall be thought laudable and pleasant to the
hearers there;‚Äù and another, to the effect that ‚Äúno mylner, shepherd, or
of other occupation, or husbandman, or husbandman servant, playing
upon pype or other instrument, shall sue (<i>follow</i>) any wedding, or other
thing that pertaineth to the said science, except in his own parish.‚Äù
Institutions like these, however, had little effect in counteracting the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
natural decline of minstrelsy, for the state of society in which it existed
was passing away. It would be curious to trace the changes in its history
by the instruments which became especially characteristic of the popular
jougleur. The harp had given way to the fiddle, and already, towards
the end of the thirteenth century, the fiddle was yielding its place to the
tabor. In the Anglo-Norman romance of Horn, of the thirteenth
century, we are told of a ribald ‚Äúwho goes to marriages to play on the
tabor‚Äù&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>Ki √† ces nocces vient pur juer od tabur</i>;<br /></span>

and the curious fabliau of the king of England and the jougleur of Ely

<span class="small table">AMUSEMENTS AFTER DINNER.&mdash;GAMBLING.&mdash;THE GAME OF CHESS.&mdash;ITS
HISTORY.&mdash;DICE.&mdash;TABLES.&mdash;DRAUGHTS.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> dinner hour, even among the highest ranks of society, was, as
I have stated, early in the forenoon; and, except in the case of
great feasts, it appears not to have been customary to sit long after dinner.
Thus a great part of the day was left on people‚Äôs hands, to fill up with
some description of amusement or occupation. After the dinner was taken
away, and the ceremony of washing had been gone through, the wine
cup appears to have been at least once passed round, before they all
rose from table. The Camden Society has recently published an early
French metrical romance (‚ÄúBlonde of Oxford,‚Äù by Philippe de Reimes),
which gives us a very interesting picture of the manners of the thirteenth
century. Jean of Dammartin is represented as the son of a noble family
in France, who comes to England to seek his fortune, and enters the
service of an earl of Oxford, as one of the esquires in his household.
There his duty is to attend upon the earl‚Äôs daughter, the lady Blonde,
and to serve her at table. ‚ÄúAfter the meal, they wash their hands and
then go to play, as each likes best, either in forests or on rivers (<i>i.e.</i> hunting
or hawking), or in amusements of other kinds. Jean goes to which
of them he likes, and, when he returns, he often goes to play in the
chambers of the countess, with the ladies, who oblige him to teach them
French.‚Äù Jean does his best to please them, for which he was qualified
by his education, ‚ÄúFor he was very well acquainted with chamber
games, such as chess, tables, and dice, with which he entertains his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
damsel (Blonde); he often says ‚Äòcheck‚Äô and ‚Äòmate‚Äô to her, and he taught
her to play many a game:‚Äù&mdash;</p>

<p>This is a correct picture of the usual occupations of the after-part of
the day among the superior classes of society in the feudal ages; and
scenes in accordance with it are often found in the illuminations of the
medi√¶val manuscripts. One of these is represented in the engraving
(<a href="#n138">No. 138</a>) on the following page, taken from a manuscript of the
fifteenth century, containing the romance of the ‚ÄúQuatre Fils d‚ÄôAymon,‚Äù
and preserved in the Library of the Arsenal, in Paris. In the chamber
in front a nobleman and one of the great ladies of his household are
engaged at chess, while in the background we see other ladies enjoying
themselves in the garden, which is shown to us with its summer-house
and its flower-beds surrounded with fences of lattice-work. It may be
remarked, that the attention of the chess-players is withdrawn suddenly
from their game by the entrance of an armed knight, who appears in
another compartment of the illumination in the manuscript.</p>

<p>Of the chamber games enumerated in the foregoing extract from the
romance of ‚ÄúBlonde of Oxford,‚Äù that of chess was no doubt looked upon
as by far the most distinguished. To play well at chess was considered as
a very important part of an aristocratic education. Thus, in the ‚ÄúChanson
de Geste‚Äù (metrical romance) of Parise la Duchessse, the son of the
heroine, who was brought up by the king in his palace, had no sooner
reached his fifteenth year, than ‚Äúhe was taught first his letters, until he
had made sufficient progress in them, and then he learnt to play at tables
and chess,‚Äù and learnt these games so well, ‚Äúthat no man in this world
was able to mate him:‚Äù&mdash;

In this numerous cycle of romances, scenes in which kings and princes,
as well as nobles, are represented as occupying their leisure with the game
of chess, occur very frequently, and sometimes the game forms an important
incident in the story. In ‚ÄúGarin le Loherain,‚Äù a messenger hurries
to Bordeaux, and finds count Thiebaut playing at chess with Berengier
d‚ÄôAutri. Thiebaut is so much excited by his news, that he pushes the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
chess-board violently from him, and scatters the chess-men about the
place&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Thiebaus l‚Äôo√Øt, √† pou n‚Äôenrage vis,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Li esch√©s boute, et le jeu espandit.</i><br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Garin le Loherain, ii. 77.<br /></span>
</span></span>

So, in the same romance, the emperor Pepin, arriving at his camp, had
no sooner entered his tent than, having put on a loose tunic (<i>bliaut</i>), and
a mantle, he called for a chess-board, and sat down to play&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Esch√©s demande, si est au jeu assis.</i><br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Ib., ii. 127.<br /></span>
</span></span>

Even Witikind, the king of the pagan Saxons, is represented as amusing
himself with this game. When the messenger, who carried him news
that Charlemagne was on the way to make war upon him, arrived at
‚ÄúTremoigne,‚Äù the palace of the Saxon king, he found Witikind playing
at chess with Escorfaus de Lutise, and the Saxon queen. Sebile, who was
also well acquainted with the game, looking on&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>Sebile les esgarde, qi do jeu est aprise.</i><br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Chanson des Saxons, i. 91.<br /></span>
</span></span>

Witikind was so angry at this intelligence, that his face ‚Äúbecame as red
as a cherry,‚Äù and he broke the chess-board to pieces&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>D‚Äôire et de mautalant rugist comme cerise;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Le message regarde, le geu pe√ßoie et brise.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

In the ‚ÄúChanson de Geste‚Äù of Guerin de Montglaive, the story turns
upon an imprudent act of Charlemagne, who stakes his whole kingdom
upon a game of chess, and losing it to Guerin, is obliged to compound
with him by surrendering to him his right to the city of Montglaive, then
in the possession of the Saracens.</p>

<p>These ‚ÄúChansons de Geste,‚Äù formed upon the traditions of the early
Carlovingian period, can only of course be taken as a picture of the
manner of the age at which they were composed, that is, of the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries, and we know, from historical evidence, that the
picture is strictly true. At that period chess certainly was what has been
termed the royal game. The celebrated Walter Mapes, writing in the
latter half of the twelfth century, gives a curious anecdote relating to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
tragical events which had occurred at the court of Britany, apparently in
the earlier part of the same century. Alan of Britany, perhaps the last
of the name who had ruled over that country, had, at the suggestion of
his wife, entrapped a feudatory prince, Remelin, and subjected him to
the loss of his eyes and other mutilations. Remelin‚Äôs son, Wigan, having
escaped a similar fate, made war upon Alan, and reduced him to such
extremities that, through the interference of the king of France, he made
his peace with Wigan, by giving him his daughter in marriage, and thus
for many years the country remained in peace. But it appears that the
lady always shared in her father‚Äôs feuds, and looked with exulting contempt
on her father‚Äôs mutilated enemy. One day she was playing with
her husband at chess, and, towards the end of the game, Wigan, called
away by some important business, asked one of his knights to take his
place at the chess-board. The lady was the conqueror, and when she
made her last move, she said to the knight, ‚ÄúIt is not to you, but to the
son of the mutilated that I say ‚Äòmate.‚Äô‚Äù Wigan heard this sarcasm, and,
deeply offended, hurried to the residence of his father-in-law, took him
by surprise, and inflicted upon him the same mutilations which had been
experienced by Remelin. Then, returning home, he engaged in another
game with his wife, and, having gained it, threw the eyes and other
parts of which her father had been deprived on the chess-board, exclaiming,
‚ÄúI say <i>mate</i>, to the daughter of the mutilated.‚Äù The story goes on
to say that the lady concealed her desire of vengeance, until she found an
opportunity of effecting the murder of her husband.</p>

<p>We need not be surprised if, among the turbulent barons of the
middle ages, the game of chess often gave rise to disputes and sanguinary
quarrels. The curious history of the Fitz-Warines, reduced to writing
certainly in the thirteenth century, gives the following account of the
origin of the feud between king John and Fulk Fitz-Warine, the outlaw:&mdash;‚ÄúYoung
Fulk,‚Äù we are told, ‚Äúwas bred with the four sons of
king Henry II., and was much beloved by them all except John; for he
used often to quarrel with John. It happened that John and Fulk were
sitting all alone in a chamber playing at chess; John took the chess-board
and struck Fulk a great blow. Fulk felt himself hurt, raised his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
foot and struck John in the middle of the stomach, that his head went
against the wall, and he became all weak and fainted. Fulk was in
consternation; but he was glad that there was nobody in the chamber
but they two, and he rubbed John‚Äôs ears, who recovered from his
fainting-fit, and went to the king his father, and made a great complaint.
‚ÄòHold your tongue, wretch,‚Äô said the king, ‚Äòyou are always quarrelling.
If Fulk did anything but good to you, it must have been by your own
desert;‚Äô and he called his master, and made him beat him finely and well
for complaining.‚Äù Similar incidents recur continually in the early romances
I have just quoted as the ‚ÄúChansons de Geste,‚Äù which give us so vivid a
picture of feudal times. A fatal quarrel of this kind was the cause of the
feud between Charlemagne and Ogier le Danois. At one of the Easter
festivals of the court of Charlemagne, the emperor‚Äôs son, Charles, and
Bauduin, the illegitimate son of Ogier, went to play together. Bauduin
and young Charles took a chess-board and sat down to the game for
pastime. ‚ÄúThey have arranged their chess-men on the board. The
king‚Äôs son first moved his pawn, and young Bauduin moved his <i>aufin</i>
(bishop) backwards. The king‚Äôs son thought to press him very hard, and
moves his knight upon the other <i>aufin</i>. The one moved forward and
the other backward so long, that young Bauduin said ‚Äòmate‚Äô to him in
the corner:‚Äù&mdash;

The young prince was furious at his defeat, and, not content with treating
the son of Ogier with the most insulting language, he seized the chess-board
in his two hands, and struck him so violent a blow on the forehead,
that he split his head, and scattered his brains over the floor. In a well-known
illuminated manuscript of the fifteenth century, in the British
Museum (MS. Reg. 15 E. vi.), containing a copy of the romance of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
‚ÄúOgier le Danois,‚Äù this scene is represented in an illumination which is
copied in our cut <a href="#n139">No. 139</a>. Similar incidents are rather common in
these old romances. In that of ‚ÄúParise la Duchesse,‚Äù her young son,
brought up as a foundling at the court of the king of Hungary, becomes
an object of jealousy to the old nobles. Four of the sons of the latter
conspire to murder him, and it is arranged that they shall invite him to
go and play at chess with them in a retired cellar, and, having secretly
provided themselves with knives, insult him, in order to draw him into a
quarrel, and then stab him to death. ‚ÄúHugues,‚Äù they said, ‚Äúwill you
come with us to play at chess? you may gain a hundred francs on the
gilt chess-board, and at the same time you will teach us chess and dice;
for certainly you know the games much better than any of us.‚Äù Hugues
seems to have been conscious of the frequency of quarrels arising from
the game, for it was not until they had promised him that they would
not seek any cause of dispute, that he accepted their invitation. They
then led him into the cellar, and sat down at the chess-board. ‚ÄúHe
began by playing with the son of duke Granier; and each put down a
hundred francs in coined money; but he had soon vanquished and mated
them all, that not one of them was able to mate him:‚Äù&mdash;

Hugues, in kindness, offered to teach them better how to play, without
allowing them to risk their money, but they drew their knives upon him,
and insulted him in the most outrageous terms. He killed the foremost
of them with a blow of his fist, and seizing upon the chess-board for a
weapon, for he was unarmed, he ‚Äúbrained‚Äù the other three with it.
We learn from this anecdote that it was the custom in the middle ages
to play at chess for money.</p>

<p>As I have already remarked, these romances picture to us the manners
of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and not those of the Carlovingian
era. The period when the game of chess was first introduced into
western Europe can only be conjectured, for writers of all descriptions
were so much in the habit of employing the notions belonging to their
own time in relating the events of the past, that we can place no dependence
on anything which is not absolute contemporary evidence. The
chess-board and men so long preserved in the treasury of St. Denis, and
said to have belonged to Charlemagne, were, I think, probably, not older
than the eleventh century, and appear to have had a Byzantine origin.
If the game of chess had been known at the court of Charlemagne,
I cannot but think that we should have found some distinct allusion to it.
The earliest mention of this game that we know is found in a letter from
Damianus, cardinal bishop of Ostia, to Alexander II., who was elected to
the papacy in 1061, and enjoyed it till 1073. Damianus tells the pope
how he was travelling with a bishop of Florence, when, ‚Äúhaving arrived
in the evening at a hostel, I withdrew,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúinto the cell of a
priest, while he remained with the crowd of travellers in the spacious
house. In the morning, I was informed by my servant that the aforesaid
bishop had been playing at the game of chess; which information, like
an arrow, pierced my heart very acutely. At a convenient hour, I sent
for him, and said in a tone of severe reproof, ‚ÄòThe hand is stretched out,
the rod is ready for the back of the offender.‚Äô ‚ÄòLet the fault be proved,‚Äô
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
said he, ‚Äòand penance shall not be refused.‚Äô ‚ÄòWas it well,‚Äô I rejoined,
‚Äòwas it worthy of the character you bear, to spend the evening in the
vanity of chess-play (<i>in vanitate scachorum</i>), and defile the hands and
tongue, which ought to be the mediator between man and the Deity?
Are you not aware that, by the canonical law, bishops, who are dice-players,
are ordered to be deposed?‚Äô He, however, making himself a
shield of defence from the difference in the names, said that dice was one
thing, and chess another; consequently that the canon only forbade dice,
but that it tacitly allowed chess. To which I replied, ‚ÄòChess,‚Äô I said, ‚Äòis
not named in the text, but the general term of dice comprehends both
the games. Wherefore, since dice are prohibited, and chess is not
expressly mentioned, it follows, without doubt, that both kinds of play
are included under one term, and equally condemned?‚Äô‚Äù This occurred
in Italy, and it is evident from it that the game of chess was then well
known there, though I think we have a right to conclude from it, that it
had not been long known. There appears to be little room for doubting,
that chess was, like so many other medi√¶val practices, an oriental invention,
that the Byzantine Greeks derived it from the Saracens, and that
from them it came by way of Italy to France.</p>

<p>The knowledge of the game of chess, however, seems to have been
brought more directly from the East by the Scandinavian navigators, to
whom such a means of passing time in their distant voyages, and in
their long nights at home, was most welcome, and who soon became
extraordinarily attached to it, and displayed their ingenuity in elaborately
carving chess-men in ivory (that is, in the ivory of the walrus), which
seem to have found an extensive market in other countries. In the year
1831, a considerable number of these carved ivory chess-men were found
on the coast of the Isle of Lewis, probably the result of some shipwreck
in the twelfth century, for to that period they belong. They formed part
of at least seven sets, and had therefore probably been the stock of a
dealer. Some of them were obtained by the British Museum, and a very
learned and valuable paper on them was communicated by sir Frederic
Madden to the Society of Antiquaries, and printed in the twenty-fourth
volume of the <i>Arch√¶ologia</i>. Some of the best of them, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
remained in private hands, and have more recently passed into the rich
museum of the late lord Londesborough. We give here two groups of these
curious chess-men, taken from the collection of lord Londesborough, and
from those in the British Museum as engraved in the volume of the
<i>Arch√¶ologia</i> just referred to. The first group, forming our cut <a href="#n140">No. 140</a>,
consists of a king (1), from the collection of lord Londesborough, and a
queen (2), bishop (3), and knight (4), all from the <i>Arch√¶ologia</i>; and the
second group (<a href="#n141">No. 141</a>) presents us with the warriors on foot, to which
the Icelanders gave the name of <i>hrokr</i>, and to which sir Frederic
Madden gives the English name of warders, one of them (5) from lord
Londesborough‚Äôs collection, the other (6) from the British Museum.
The rest are pawns, all from the latter collection; they are generally
plain and octagonal, as in the group to the right (7), but were sometimes
ornamented, as in the case of the other example (8).</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 140. Icelandic Chess-men of the Twelfth Century.</i></p></div>

<p>It will be seen at once that in name and character these chess-men
are nearly identical with those in common use, although in costume they
are purely Scandinavian. The king sits in the position, with his sword
across his knee, and his hand ready to draw it, which is described as characteristic
of royalty in the old northern poetry. The queen holds in her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
hand a drinking horn, in which at great festivals the lady of the household,
of whatever rank, was accustomed to serve out the ale or mead to
the guests. The bishops are some seated, and others standing, but all distinguished
by the mitre, crosier, and episcopal costume. The knights are
all on horseback, and are covered with characteristic armour. The armed
men on foot, just mentioned by the name of warders, were peculiar to the
Scandinavian set of chess-men, and supplied the place of the rocks, or
rooks, in the medi√¶val game, and of the modern castle.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n141" src="images/i_n141.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 141. Icelandic Chess-men of the Twelfth Century.</i></p></div>

<p>Several of the chess-men had indeed gone through more than one
modification in their progress from the East. The Arabs and Persians
admitted no female among the persons on their chess-board, and the
piece which we call the queen was with them the <i>pherz</i> (vizier or councillor).
The oriental name, under the form <i>fers</i>, <i>ferz</i>, or <i>ferce</i>, in Latin
<i>ferzia</i>, was long preferred in the middle ages, though certainly as early as
the twelfth century the original character of the piece had been changed
for that of a queen, and the names <i>fers</i> and queen became synonymous.
It is hardly necessary to say that a bishop would not be found on a
Saracenic chess-board. This piece was called by the Persians and Arabs
<i>pil</i> or <i>phil</i>, meaning an elephant, under the form of which animal it was
represented. This name was also preserved in its transmission to the
west, and with the Arab article prefixed became <i>alfil</i>, or more commonly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
<i>alfin</i>, which was again softened down into <i>aufin</i>, the usual name of the
piece in the old French and English writers. The character of the bishop
must have been adopted very early among the Christians, and it is found
under that character among the Northerns, and in England. Such, however,
was not the case everywhere. The Russians and Swedes have preserved
the original name of the elephant. In Italy and France this piece
was sometimes represented as an archer; and at an early period in the
latter country, from a supposed confusion of the Arabic <i>fil</i> with the
French <i>fol</i>, it was sometimes called by the latter name, and represented
as a court jester. <i>Roc</i>, the name given by the Saracens to the piece now
called the castle, meant apparently a hero, or champion, Persian <i>rokh</i>;
the name was preserved in the middle ages, but the piece seems to have
been first represented under the character of an elephant, and it was no
doubt, from the tower which the elephant carried on its back, that our
modern form originated. The Icelanders seem alone to have adopted
the name in its original meaning, for with them, as shown in cut
No. 141, the <i>hrokr</i> is represented as a warrior on foot.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n142" src="images/i_n142.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 142. Chess-man of the Thirteenth Century.</i></p></div>

<p>A few examples of carved chess-men have been found in different
parts of England, which show that these highly-ornamented pieces were
in use at all periods. One of these, represented in our cut <a href="#n142">No. 142</a>, is
preserved in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, and, to judge by the
costume, belongs to the earlier part of the thirteenth century. Its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
material is the tooth of the walrus (the northern ivory); it represents
a knight on both sides, one wielding a lance, the other a sword, the
intervening spaces being filled with
foliage. Another knight, made of
real ivory, is represented in our cut
No. 143, taken from an engraving
in the third volume of the <i>Arch√¶ological
Journal</i>, where it is stated to
be in the possession of the Rev. J.
Eagles, of Worcester. It belongs
to the reign of Edward III. Here
the knight is on horseback, and
wears chain-mail and plate. The
body of the horse is entirely covered
with chain-mail, over which housings are placed, and the head with
plate-armour.</p>

<p>All who are acquainted with the general character of medi√¶val
carving will suppose that these ornamental chess-men were of large
dimensions, and consequently rather clumsy for use. The largest of those
found in the Isle of Lewis, a king, is upwards of four inches in height,
and nearly seven inches in circumference. They were hence rather formidable
weapons in a strong hand, and we find them used as such in some
of the scenes of the early romances. According to one version of the death
of Bauduin, the illegitimate son of Ogier, the young prince Charles struck
him with the rook so violent a blow that he made his two eyes fly out:&mdash;</p>

<p>A rather rude illumination is one of the manuscripts, of which
M. Barrois has given a fac-simile in his edition of this romance, representing
Charles striking his opponent with the rook. According to
another version of the story, the young prince, using the rook as a missile,
threw it at him. An incident in the romance of the ‚ÄúQuatre Fils
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
d‚ÄôAymon,‚Äù where the agents of Regnault go to arrest the duke Richard
of Normandy, and find him playing at chess, is thus told quaintly in the
English version, printed by Copeland:&mdash;‚ÄúWhen duke Richarde saw that
these sergeauntes had him thus by the arm, and helde in his hande a lady
of ivery, wherewith he would have given a mate to Yonnet, he withdrew
his arme, and gave to one of the sergeauntes such a stroke with it into
the forehead, that he made him tumble over and over at his feete; and
than he tooke a rooke, and smote another withall upon his head, that he
all to-brost it to the brayne.‚Äù</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n144" src="images/i_n144.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 144. An Early Chess-board and Chess-men.</i></p></div>

<p>The chess-boards were naturally large, and were sometimes made of
the precious metals, and of other rich materials. In one romance, the
chess-board and men are made of crystal; in another, that of ‚ÄúAlexander,‚Äù
the men are made of sapphires and topazes. A chess-board, preserved in
the museum of the H√¥tel de Cluny, at Paris, and said to have been the
one given by the old man of the mountains (the sheikh of the Hassassins)
to St. Louis, is made of rock-crystal, and mounted in silver gilt. In the
romances, however, the chess-board is sometimes spoken of as made of
<i>ormier</i>, or elm. In fact, when the game of chess came into extensive use,
it became necessary not only to make the chess-board and men of less
expensive materials and smaller, but to give to the latter simple conventional
forms, instead of making them elaborate sculptures. The foundation
for this latter practice had already been laid by the Arabs, whose
tenets, contrary to those of the Persians, proscribed all images of living
beings. The medi√¶val conventional form of the rook, a figure with a
bi-parted head, somewhat approaching to the heraldic form of the fleur-de-lis,
appears to have been taken directly from the Arabs. The knight
was represented by a small upright column, the upper part of it bent to
one side, and is supposed to have been meant for a rude representation of
the horse‚Äôs head. The aufin, or bishop, had the same form as the knight,
except that the bent end was cleft, probably as an indication of the
episcopal mitre. The accompanying figure of a chess-board (<a href="#n144">No. 144</a>),
taken from a manuscript of the earlier part of the fourteenth century
(MS. Cotton. Cleopat. B. ix.), but no doubt copied from one of the latter
part of the thirteenth century, when the Anglo-Norman metrical treatise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
on chess which it illustrates was composed, gives all the conventional
forms of chess-men used at that time. The piece at the left-hand
extremity of the lower row is evidently a king. The other king is seen
in the centre of the upper row. Immediately to the left of the latter is
the queen, and the two figures below the king and queen are knights,
while those to the left of the queen and white knight are rooks. Those
in the right-hand corner, at top and bottom, are aufins, or bishops. The
pawns on this chess-board bear a striking resemblance to those found in
the Isle of Lewis. The same forms, with very slight variations, present
themselves in the scenes of chess-playing as depicted in the illuminated
manuscripts. Thus, in a manuscript of the French prose romance of
‚ÄúMeliadus,‚Äù in the British Museum (MS. Addit. No. 12,228, fol. 23, v<sup>o</sup>),
written between the years 1330 and 1350, we have an interesting sketch
(given in our cut <a href="#n145">No. 145</a>) of two kings engaged in this game. The
rooks and the bishops are distinctly represented, but the others are less
easily recognised, in consequence of the imperfect drawing. Our next
cut (<a href="#n146">No. 146</a>) is taken from the well-known manuscript of the poetry of
the German Minnesingers, made for Rudiger von Manesse, early in the
fourteenth century, and now preserved in the National Library in Paris,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
and represents the prince poet, Otto of Brandenburg, playing at chess
with a lady. We have here the same conventional forms of chess-men, a
circumstance which shows that the same types prevailed in England,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
France, and Germany. Another group, in which a king is introduced
playing at chess, forms the subject of our cut <a href="#n147">No. 147</a>, and is taken from
a manuscript of the thirteenth century, in
the Harleian collection in the British
Museum (No. 1275), consisting of a numerous
series of illustrations of the Bible
history, executed evidently in England.
It will be seen that the character of chess
as a royal game is sustained throughout.</p>

<p>In this century the game of chess had
become extremely popular among the
feudal aristocracy&mdash;including under that head all who could aspire to
knighthood. Already, in the twelfth century, directions for the game
had been composed in Latin verse, which seems to show that, in spite
of the zeal of men like cardinal Damianus, it was popular among the
clergy. Towards the latter end of the thirteenth century, a French
dominican friar, Jacques de Cessoles, made the game the subject of a
moral work, entitled <i>Moralitas de Scaccario</i>, which became very popular
in later times, was published in a French version by Jean de Vignay, and
translated from this French version into English, by Caxton, in his ‚ÄúBoke
of Chesse,‚Äù so celebrated among bibliographers. To the age of Jacques
de Cessoles belongs an Anglo-Norman metrical treatise on chess, of which
several copies are preserved in manuscript (the one I have used is in MS.
Reg. 13 A. xviii. fol. 161, v<sup>o</sup>), and which presents us with the first
collection of games. These games are distinguished by quaint names,
like those given to the old dances; such as <i>de propre confusion</i> (one‚Äôs own
confusion), <i>ky perde, sey sauve</i> (the loser wins), <i>ky est larges, est sages</i> (he
that is liberal is wise), <i>meschief fet hom penser</i> (misfortune makes a man
reflect), <i>la chace de ferce et de chivaler</i> (the chace of the queen and the
knight), <i>de dames et de damyceles</i> (ladies and damsels), <i>la batalie de rokes</i>
(the battle of the rooks), and the like.</p>

<p>It is quite unnecessary to attempt to point out the numerous allusions
to the game of chess during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, when
it continued to be extremely popular. Chaucer, in one of his minor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
poems, the ‚ÄúBoke of the Duchesse,‚Äù introduces himself in a dream as
playing at chess with Fortune, and speaks of false moves, as though dishonest
tricks were sometimes practised in the game. He tells us,&mdash;</p>

<p>With the breaking up of feudalism, the game of chess seems to have
gone to a great extent out of practice, and made way for a comparatively
new game,&mdash;that of cards, which now became very popular. When
Caxton printed his ‚ÄúBoke of Chesse‚Äù in 1474, he sought only to publish
a moral treatise, and not to furnish his countrymen with a book of
instructions in the game. The cut of the chess-player given in this book,
copied in our cut <a href="#n148">No. 148</a>, shows some modifications in the forms of the
chess-men. The knight, the rook, and the pawn, have preserved their
old forms; but we are led to suppose, by the number of pieces with the
bi-partite head, that the bishop had assumed a shape nearly resembling
that of the rook. We have just seen Chaucer alluding to one of the
legends relating to the origin of this game. Caxton, after Jean de Vignay
and Jacques de Cessoles, gives us a strange story how it was invented
under Evylmerodach, king of Babylon, by a philosopher, ‚Äúwhyche was
named in Caldee Exerses, or in Greke Philemetor.‚Äù</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the game of chess had continued to flourish in Italy,
where it appears to have experienced improvements, and where certainly
the forms of the men were considerably modified. An Italian version of
the work of Jacques de Cessoles was printed at Florence in 1493, under
the title of <i>Libro de Giuocho delli Scacchi</i>, among the engravings to which,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
as in most of the editions of that work, there is a picture of a group of
chess-players, who are here seated at a round table. The chess-board is
represented in our cut, <a href="#n149">No. 149</a>, and it will be seen at a glance that the
chess-men present a far greater resemblance to those used at the present
day than those given in the older illuminations. Within a few years of
the date of this book, a Portuguese, named Damiano, who was perhaps
residing in Italy, as his work seems to have appeared there first, drew up
a book of directions for chess with a set of eighty-eight games, which
display considerable ingenuity. An edition of this book was published at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
Rome as early as 1524, and perhaps this was not the first. The figures
of the chess-men are given in this treatise; that of the king is vase-shaped,
not unlike our modern chess-king, but with two crowns; the
queen is similar in shape, but has one crown; the <i>delfino</i> (bishop) differs
from them in being smaller, and having no crown; the <i>cavallo</i> (knight)
has the form of a horse‚Äôs head; the <i>rocho</i>, as it is still called, is in the
form of a tower, like our modern castle; and the <i>pedona</i> (pawn) resembles
a cone, with a knob at the apex. In England, the game of chess seems
not to have been much in vogue during the sixteenth century; it is,
I believe, only alluded to once in Shakespeare, in a well-known scene in
the Tempest, which may have been taken from a foreign story, to which
he owed his plot. The name of the game had been corrupted into
<i>chests</i> or <i>cheasts</i>. The game of chess was expressly discouraged by our
‚ÄúSolomon,‚Äù James I., as ‚Äúoverwise and philosophicke a folly.‚Äù An
attempt to bring it into more notice appears to have been made early in
the reign of Elizabeth, under the patronage of lord Robert Dudley,
afterwards the celebrated earl of Leicester, who displayed on many occasions
a taste for refinements of this sort. Instructions were again sought
from Italy through France; for there was printed and published in
London, in the year 1562, a little volume dedicated to lord Robert
Dudley, under the title of ‚ÄúThe Pleasaunt and wittie Playe of the Cheasts
reniewed, with Instructions both to Learn it Easily and to Play it Well;
lately translated out of Italian into French, and now set forth in Englishe
by James Rowbotham.‚Äù Rowbotham gives us some remarks of his own
on the character of the game, and on the different forms of the chess-men,
which are not uninteresting. He says:&mdash;‚ÄúAs for the fashion of the
pieces, that is according to the fantasie of the workman, which maketh
them after this manner. Some make them lyke men, whereof the
kynge is the highest, and the queene (whiche some name amasone or
ladye) is the next, bothe two crowned. The bishoppes some name
alphins, some fooles, and some name them princes, lyke as also they are
next unto the kinge and the queene, other some cal them archers, and
thei are fashioned accordinge to the wyll of the workeman. The knights
some call horsemen, and thei are men on horse backe. The rookes some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
cal elephantes, cariyng towres upon their backes, and men within the
towres. The paunes some cal fote men, as they are souldiours on fote,
cariyng some of them pykes, other some harquebushes, other some
halbards, and other some the javelyn and target. Other makers of
cheastmen make them of other fashions; but the use thereof wyll cause
perfect knowledge.‚Äù ‚ÄúOur Englishe cheastmen,‚Äù he adds, ‚Äúare commonly
made nothing like unto these foresayde fashions: to wit, the
kynge is made the highest or longest; the queene is longest nexte unto
him; the bishoppe is made with a sharpe toppe, and cloven in the
middest not muche unlyke to a bishop‚Äôs myter; the knight hath his top
cut asloope, as thoughe beynge dubbed knight; the rooke is made lykest
to the kynge and the queene, but that he is not so long; the paunes be
made the smalest and least of all, and thereby they may best be
knowen.‚Äù</p>

<p>At an early period the German tribes, as known to the Romans, were
notoriously addicted to gambling. We are informed by Tacitus that a
German in his time would risk not only his property, but his own
personal liberty, on a throw of the dice; and if he lost, he submitted
patiently, as a point of honour, to be bound by his opponent, and carried
to the market to be sold into slavery. The Anglo-Saxons appear to have
shared largely in this passion, and their habits of gambling are alluded to
in different writers. A well-known writer of the first half of the twelfth
century, Ordericus Vitalis, tells us that in his time even the prelates of
the church were in the habit of playing at dice. A still more celebrated
writer, John of Salisbury, who lived a little later in the same century,
speaks of dice-playing as being then extremely prevalent, and enumerates
no less than ten different games, which he names in Latin, as follows:&mdash;<i>tessera</i>,
<i>calculus</i>, <i>tabula</i> (tables), <i>urio vel Dardana pugna</i> (Troy fight),
<i>tricolus</i>, <i>senio</i> (sice), <i>monarchus</i>, <i>orbiculi</i>, <i>taliorchus</i>, and <i>vulpes</i> (the game
of fox).&mdash;‚ÄúDe Nugis Curialium,‚Äù lib. i. c. 5. The sort of estimation in
which the game was then held is curiously illustrated by an anecdote in
the Carlovingian romance of ‚ÄúParise la Duchesse,‚Äù where the king of the
Hungarians wishes to contrive some means of telling the real character
(aristocratic or plebeian) of his foundling, young Hugues, not then known
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
to be the son of the duchess Parise. A party of robbers (which appears
not to have been a specially disreputable avocation among the Hungarians
of the romance) are employed, first to seduce the youth to ‚Äúthe chess
and the dice,‚Äù and afterwards to lead him against his will to a thieving
expedition, the object of which was to rob the treasury of the king, his
godfather. They made a great hole in the wall, and thrust Hugues
through it. The youth beheld the heaps of gold and silver with astonishment,
but, resolved to touch none of the wealth he saw around him, his
eyes fell upon a coffer on which lay three dice, ‚Äúmade and pointed in
fine ivory‚Äù&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Garde for i. escrin, si a veu iij. dez,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Qui sont de fin yvoire et fait et pointur√©.</i><br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Parise la Duchesse, p. 94.<br /></span>
</span></span>

Hugues seized the three dice, thrust them into his bosom, and, returning
through the breach in the wall, told the robbers that he had carried away
‚Äúthe worth of four cities.‚Äù When the robbers heard his explanation,
they at once concluded, from the taste he had displayed on this occasion,
that he was of gentle blood, and the king formed the same opinion on
the result of this trial.</p>

<p>During the period of which we are now speaking&mdash;the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries&mdash;the use of dice had spread itself from the highest to
the very lowest class of the population. In its simpler form, that of the
game of hazard, in which the chance of each player rested on the mere
throw of the dice, it was the common game of the low frequenters of
the taverns,&mdash;that class which lived upon the vices of society, and which
was hardly looked upon as belonging to society itself. The practice and
results of gambling are frequently referred to in the popular writers of
the later middle ages. People could no longer stake their personal
liberty on the throw, but they played for everything they had&mdash;even for
the clothes they carried upon them, on which the tavern-keepers, who
seem to have acted also as pawnbrokers, readily lent small sums of money.
We often read of men who got into the taverner‚Äôs hands, playing as well
as drinking themselves naked; and in a well-known manuscript of the
beginning of the fourteenth century (MS. Reg. 2 B. vii. fol. 167 v<sup>o</sup>) we
find an illumination which represents this process very literally (cut No.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
150). One, who is evidently the more aged of the two players, is
already perfectly naked, whilst the other is reduced to his shirt. The
illuminator appears to have intended to represent them as playing
against each other till neither had anything left, like the two celebrated
cats of Kilkenny, who ate one another up until nothing remained but
their tails.</p>

<p>A burlesque parody on the church service, written in Latin, perhaps
as early as the thirteenth century, and printed in the ‚Äú<i>Reliqui√¶ Antiqu√¶</i>,‚Äù
gives us rather a curious picture of tavern manners at that early period.
The document is profane,&mdash;much more so than any of the parodies for
which Hone was prosecuted; but it is only a
moderate example of the general laxness in this
respect which prevailed, even among the clergy,
in what have been called ‚Äúthe ages of faith.‚Äù
This is entitled ‚ÄúThe Mass of the Drunkards,‚Äù
and contains a running allusion to the throwing of
the three dice, and to the loss of clothing which
followed; but it is full of Latin puns on the
words of the church service, and the greater
part of it would not bear a translation.</p>

<p>It will have been already remarked that, in
all these anecdotes and stories, the ordinary number
of the dice is three. This appears to have
been the number used in most of the common games. In our cut
No. 151, taken from the illumination in a copy of Jean de Vignay‚Äôs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
translation of Jacobus de Cessolis (MS. Reg. 19 C. xi.), the dice-player
appears to hold but two dice in his hand; but this is to be laid solely to
the charge of the draughtsman‚Äôs want of skill, as the text tells us distinctly
that he has three. We learn also from the text, that in the jug
he holds in his right hand he carries his money, a late example of the
use of earthen vessels for this purpose. Two dice were, however, sometimes
used, especially in the game of hazard, which appears to have been
the great gambling game of the middle ages. Chaucer, in the ‚ÄúPardoneres
Tale,‚Äù describes the hazardours as playing with two dice. But
in the curious scene in the ‚ÄúTowneley Mysteries‚Äù (p. 241), a work
apparently contemporary with Chaucer, the tormentors, or executioners,
are introduced throwing for Christ‚Äôs unseamed garment with three dice;
the winner throws fifteen points, which could only be thrown with that
number of dice.</p>

<div class="figright"><img id="n152" src="images/i_n152.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 152. Ornamental Dice.</i></p></div>

<p>It would not seem easy to give much ornamentation to the form of
dice without destroying their utility, yet this has been attempted at
various times, and not only in a very grotesque but in a similar manner
at very distant periods. This was done by giving the die the form of a
man, so doubled up, that when thrown
he fell in different positions, so as to
show the points uppermost, like an
ordinary die. The smaller example
represented in our cut <a href="#n152">No. 152</a> is
Roman, and made of silver, and several
Roman dice of the same form are
known. It is singular that the same idea should have presented itself at
a much later period, and, as far as we can judge, without any room for
supposing that it was by imitation. Our second example, which is larger
than the other, and carved in box-wood, is of German work, and apparently
as old as the beginning of the sixteenth century. Both are now
in the fine and extensive collection of the late lord Londesborough.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img id="n153" src="images/i_n153.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 153. A Party at Tables.</i></p></div>

<p>The simple throwing of the dice was rather an excitement than an
amusement; and at an early period people sought the latter by a combination
of the dice-throwing with some other system of movements or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
calculations. In this way, no doubt, originated the different games
enumerated by John of Salisbury, the most popular of which was
that of tables (<i>tabula</i> or <i>tabul√¶</i>). This game was in use among the
Romans, and was in all probability borrowed from them by the Anglo-Saxons,
among whom it was in great favour, and who called the game
<i>t√¶fel</i> (evidently a mere adoption of the Latin name), and the dice <i>teoselas</i>
and <i>t√¶fel-stanas</i>. The former evidently represents the Latin <i>tessell√¶</i>, little
cubes; and the latter seems to show that the Anglo-Saxon dice were usually
made of stones. At a later period, the game of <i>tables</i>, used nearly always
in the plural, is continually mentioned along with chess, as the two most
fashionable and aristocratic games in use. An early and richly illuminated
manuscript in the British Museum&mdash;perhaps
of the beginning of the
fourteenth century (MS. Harl.
No. 1257)&mdash;furnishes us with the
figures of players at tables represented
in our cut <a href="#n153">No. 153</a>.
The table, or board, with bars or
points, is here clearly delineated,
and we see that the players use
both dice and men, or pieces&mdash;the
latter round discs, like our modern draughtsmen. In another manuscript,
belonging to a rather later period of the fourteenth century (MS.
Reg. 13 A. xviii. fol. 157, v<sup>o</sup>), we have a diagram which shows the board
as composed of two tables, represented in our cut <a href="#n154">No. 154</a>. It was
probably this construction which caused the name to be used in the
plural; and as the Anglo-Saxons always used the name in the singular,
as is the case also with John of Salisbury in the twelfth century, while
the plural is always used by the writers of a later date, we seem justified
in concluding that the board used by the Anglo-Saxons and Anglo-Normans
consisted of one table, like that represented in our cut <a href="#n153">No. 153</a>,
and that this was afterwards superseded by the double board. It is hardly
necessary to point out to our readers that these two pictures of the boards
show us clearly that the medi√¶val game of tables was identical with our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
modern backgammon, or rather, we should perhaps say, that the game of
backgammon, as now played, is one of the games played on the tables.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n154" src="images/i_n154.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 154. A Table-Board (Backgammon) of the Fourteenth Century.</i></p></div>

<p>In the manuscript last quoted (MS. Reg. 13 A. xviii.) the figure of the
board is given to illustrate a very curious treatise on the game of tables,
written in Latin, in the fourteenth, or even perhaps in the thirteenth,
century. The writer begins by informing us, that ‚Äúthere are many
games at tables with dice, of which the first is the long game, and is
the game of the English, and it is common, and played as follows‚Äù
(<i>multi sunt ludi ad tabulas cum taxillis, quorum primus est longus ludus, et
est ludus Anglicorum, et est communis, et est talis natur√¶</i>), meaning, I
presume, that it was the game usually played in England. From the
directions given for playing it, this game seems to have had a close
general resemblance to backgammon. The writer of the treatise says
that it was played with three dice, or with two dice, in which latter case
they counted six at each throw for the third dice. In some of the other
games described here, two dice only were used. We learn from this
treatise the English terms for two modes of winning at the ‚Äúlong game‚Äù
of tables&mdash;the one being called ‚Äúlympoldyng,‚Äù the other ‚Äúlurchyng;‚Äù
and a person losing by the former was said to be ‚Äúlympolded.‚Äù The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
writer of this tract gives directions for playing at several other games of
tables, and names some of them&mdash;such as ‚Äúpaume carie,‚Äù the Lombard‚Äôs
game (<i>ludus Lombardorum</i>), the ‚Äúimperial,‚Äù the ‚Äúprovincial,‚Äù ‚Äúbaralie,‚Äù
and ‚Äúfaylys.‚Äù</p>

<p>This game continued long to exist in England under its old name of
<i>tables</i>. Thus Shakespeare:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That, when he plays at</i> tables, <i>chides the dice</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Love‚Äôs Labour‚Äôs Lost, Act v. Sc. 2.<br /></span>
</span></span>

The game appears at this time to have been a favourite one in the taverns
and ordinaries. Thus, in a satirical tract in verse, printed in 1600, we are
told of&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>An honest vicker, and a kind consort,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That to the alehouse friendly would resort,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To have a game at</i> tables <i>now and than,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or drinke his pot as soone as any man</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Letting of Humours Blood, 1600.<br /></span>
</span></span>

And one of the most popular of the satirical writers of that period,
Dekker, in his ‚ÄúLanthorne and Candle-Light,‚Äù printed in 1620, says,
punningly,&mdash;‚ÄúAnd knowing that your most selected gallants are the
onelye <i>table-men</i> that are plaid withal at ordinaries, into an ordinarye did
he most gentleman-like convay himselfe in state.‚Äù We learn from
another tract of the same author, the ‚ÄúGul‚Äôs Hornbooke,‚Äù that the table-men
at this time were usually painted.</p>

<p>We hardly perceive how the name of tables disappeared. It seems
probable that at this time the game of tables meant simply what we now
call backgammon, a word the oldest mention of which, so far as I have
been able to discover, occurs in Howell‚Äôs ‚ÄúFamiliar Letters,‚Äù first printed
in 1646. It is there written <i>baggamon</i>. In the ‚ÄúCompleat Gamester,‚Äù
1674, backgammon and ticktack occur as two distinct games at what
would have formerly been called tables; and another similar game was
called Irish. Curiously enough, in the earlier part of the last century the
game of backgammon was most celebrated as a favourite game among
country parsons.</p>

<p>Another game existing in the middle ages, but much more rarely
alluded to, was called <i>dames</i>, or ladies, and has still preserved that name
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
in French. In English, it was changed for that of <i>draughts</i>, derived no
doubt from the circumstance of <i>drawing</i> the men from one square to
another. Our cut <a href="#n155">No. 155</a>, taken from a manuscript in the British
Museum of the beginning of the fourteenth century, known commonly
as Queen Mary‚Äôs Psalter (MS. Reg. 2 B. vii.), represents a lady and
gentleman playing at dames, or draughts, differing only from the character
of the game at the present day in the circumstance that the
draughtsmen are evidently square.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 156. Cards in the Fourteenth Century.</i></p></div>

<p>The medi√¶val games were gradually superseded by a new contrivance,
that of playing-cards, which were introduced into Western Europe in the
course of the fourteenth century. It has been suggested that the idea of
playing-cards was taken from chess&mdash;in fact, that they are the game of
chess transferred to paper, and without a board, and they are generally
understood to have been derived from the East. Cards, while they
possessed some of the characteristics of chess, presented the same mixture
of chance and skill which distinguished the game of tables. An Italian
writer, probably of the latter part of the fifteenth century, named Cavelluzzo,
author of a history of Viterbo, states that ‚Äúin the year 1379 was
brought into Viterbo the game of cards, which comes from the country
of the Saracens, and is with them called <i>naib</i>.‚Äù Cards are still in Spanish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
called <i>naipes</i>, which is said to be derived from the Arabic: but they
were certainly known in the west of Europe before the date given by
Cavelluzzo. Our cut <a href="#n156">No. 156</a> is taken from a very fine manuscript of
the romance of ‚ÄúMeliadus,‚Äù in the British Museum (MS. Addit. 12,228,
fol. 313, v<sup>o</sup>), which was written apparently in the south of France between
the years 1330 and 1350; it represents a royal party playing at cards,
which was therefore considered at that time as the amusement of the
highest classes of society. They are, however, first distinctly alluded to in
history in the year 1393. In that year Charles VI. of France was
labouring under a visitation of insanity; and we find in the accounts of
his treasurer, Charles Poupart, an entry to the following effect:&mdash;‚ÄúGiven
to Jacquemin Gringonneur, painter, for three packs of cards, gilt and
diversly coloured, and ornamented with several devices, to deliver to the
lord the king for his amusement, fifty-six sols of Paris.‚Äù It is clear from
this entry that the game of cards was then tolerably well known in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
France, and that it was by no means new, though it was evidently not
a common game, and the cards had to be made by a painter&mdash;that is, as
I suppose, an illuminator of manuscripts. We find as yet no allusion to
them in England: and it is remarkable that neither Chaucer, nor any of
the numerous writers of his and the following age, ever speak of them.
An illuminated manuscript of apparently the earlier part of the fifteenth
century, perhaps of Flemish workmanship (it contains a copy of Raoul de
Presle‚Äôs French translation of St. Augustine‚Äôs ‚ÄúCivitas Dei‚Äù), presents us
with another card-party, which we give in our cut <a href="#n157">No. 157</a>. Three
persons are here engaged in the game, two of whom are ladies. After
the date at which three packs of cards were made for the amusement of
the lunatic king, the game of cards seems soon to have become common
in France; for less than four years later&mdash;on the 22nd of January, 1397&mdash;the
provost of Paris considered it necessary to publish an edict, forbidding
working people to play at tennis, bowls, dice, <i>cards</i>, or ninepins, on
working days. By one of the acts of the synod of Langres, in 1404, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
clergy were expressly forbidden to play at cards. These had now made
their way into Germany, and had become so popular there, that early in
the fifteenth century card-making had become a regular trade.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n157" src="images/i_n157.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 157. Cards in the Fifteenth Century.</i></p></div>

<p>In England, in the third year of the reign of Edward IV. (1463), the
importation of playing-cards, probably from Germany, was forbidden,
among other things, by act of parliament; and as that act is understood to
have been called for by the English manufacturers, who suffered by the
foreign trade, it can hardly be doubted that cards were then manufactured
in England on a rather extensive scale. Cards had then, indeed, evidently
become very popular in England; and only twenty years afterwards they
are spoken of as the common Christmas game, for Margery Paston wrote
as follows to her husband, John Paston, on the 24th of December in
1483:&mdash;‚ÄúPlease it you to weet (know) that I sent your eldest son John to
my lady Morley, to have knowledge of what sports were used in her
house in the Christmas next following after the decease of my lord her
husband; and she said that there were none disguisings, nor harpings,
nor luting, nor singing, nor none loud disports, but playing at the tables,
and the chess, and <i>cards</i>&mdash;such disports she gave her folks leave to
play, and none other.... I sent your younger son to the lady
Stapleton, and she said according to my lady Morley‚Äôs saying in that,
and as she had seen used in places of worship (<i>gentlemen‚Äôs houses</i>) there
as she had been.‚Äù</p>

<p>From this time the mention of cards becomes frequent. They formed
the common amusement in the courts of England and Scotland under
the reigns of Henry VII. and James IV.; and it is recorded that when
the latter monarch paid his first visit to his affianced bride, the young
princess Margaret of England, ‚Äúhe founde the quene playing at the
cardes.‚Äù</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that it is partly to the use of playing cards
that we owe the invention which has been justly regarded as one of the
greatest benefits granted to mankind. The first cards, as we have seen,
were painted with the hand. They were subsequently made more
rapidly by a process called stencilling&mdash;that is, by cutting the rude forms
through a piece of pasteboard, parchment, or thin metal, which, placed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
on the cardboard intended to receive the impression, was brushed over
with ink or colour, which passed through the cut out lines, and imparted
the figure to the material beneath. A further improvement was made
by cutting the figures on blocks of wood, and literally printing them on
the cards. These card-blocks are supposed to have given the first idea of
wood-engraving. When people saw the effects of cutting the figures of
the cards upon blocks, they began to cut figures of saints on blocks in the
same manner, and then applied the method to other subjects, cutting in
like manner the few words of necessary explanation. This practice
further expanded itself into what are called block-books, consisting of
pictorial subjects, with copious explanatory text. Some one at length hit
upon the idea of cutting the pages of a regular book on so many blocks of
wood, and taking impressions on paper or vellum, instead of writing the
manuscript; and this plan was soon further improved by cutting letters
or words on separate pieces of wood, and setting them up together to
form pages. The wood was subsequently superseded by metal. And
thus originated the noble art of <span class="smcap">Printing</span>.

<span class="small table">DOMESTIC AMUSEMENTS AFTER DINNER.&mdash;THE CHAMBER AND ITS
FURNITURE.&mdash;PET ANIMALS.&mdash;OCCUPATIONS AND MANNERS OF THE
LADIES.&mdash;SUPPER.&mdash;CANDLES, LAMPS, AND LANTERNS.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">When</span> the dinner was over, and hands washed, a drink was served
round, and then the ladies left the table, and went to their
chambers or to the garden or fields, to seek their own amusements, which
consisted frequently of dancing, in which they were often joined by the
younger of the male portion of the household, while the others remained
drinking. They seem often to have gone to drink in another apartment,
or secondary hall, perhaps in the parlour. In the romance of ‚ÄúLa
Violette‚Äù (p. 159), we read of the father of a family going to sleep after
dinner. In the same romance (p. 152), the young ladies and gentlemen
of a noble household are described as spreading themselves over the castle,
to amuse themselves, attended by minstrels with music. From other
romances we find that this amusement consisted often in dancing, and
that the ladies sometimes sang for themselves, instead of having minstrels.
We find these amusements alluded to in the fabliaux and romances of
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. In one of the fabliaux, a knight
having been received hospitably at a feudal castle, after dinner they wash,
and drink round, and then they go to dance&mdash;

In the early English romance of ‚ÄúSir Degrevant,‚Äù after dinner the ladies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
go to their chambers to arrange themselves, and then some proceed to
amuse themselves in the garden&mdash;

In the romance of ‚ÄúLanfal,‚Äù we have the same circumstance of dancing
after dinner:&mdash;

It was only on extraordinary occasions, however, that the dancing or
walking in the garden continued all day. In the romance of ‚ÄúBlonde of
Oxford,‚Äù the dinner-party quit the table, to wander in the fields and
forests round the castle, and the young hero of the story, on their return
thence, goes to play in the chambers with the ladies:&mdash;</p>

<p>There were two classes of dances in the middle ages, the domestic
dances, and the dances of the jougleurs or minstrels. After the first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
crusades, the western jougleurs had adopted many of the practices of their
brethren in the east, and, among others, it is evident from many allusions
in old writers that they had brought westward that of the ‚Äúalmehs,‚Äù or
eastern dancing-girls. These dances formed, like the vulgar fabliaux, a
part of the jougleur‚Äôs budget of representations, and were mostly, like
those, gross and indecent. The other class of dances were of a simpler
character,&mdash;the domestic dances, which consisted chiefly of the <i>carole</i>, in
which ladies and gentlemen, alternately, held by each other‚Äôs hands and
danced in a circle. This mode of dance prevailed so generally, that the
word <i>carole</i> became used as a general term for a dance, and <i>caroler</i>, to
carole, was equivalent with <i>to dance</i>. The accompanying cut (<a href="#n158">No. 158</a>),
taken from a manuscript of the Roman de Tristan, of the fourteenth
century, in the National Library at Paris (No. 6956), represents a party
dancing the carole to the music of pipe and tabor. A dance of another
description is represented in our next cut (<a href="#n159">No. 159</a>), taken from a manuscript
in the British Museum (MS. Reg. 2 B. vii. fol. 174), also of the
fourteenth century. Here the minstrels themselves appear to be joining
in the saltitation which they inspire. It is a good illustration of the scene
described from the romance of ‚ÄúLa Violette.‚Äù On festive occasions
this dancing often continued till supper-time.</p>

<p>Other quieter games were pursued in the chambers. Among these
the most dignified was chess, after which came tables, draughts, and, in
the fourteenth century, cards. Sometimes, as described in the preceding
chapter, they played at sedentary games, such as chess and tables; or at
diversions of a still more frolicsome character. These latter seem to have
been most in vogue in the evening after supper. The author of the
‚ÄúM√©nagier de Paris,‚Äù written about the year 1393 (tom. i. p. 71),
describes the ladies as playing, in an evening, at games named <i>bric</i>, and
<i>qui fery?</i> (who struck?), and <i>pince merille</i>, and <i>tiers</i>, and others. The first
of these games is mentioned about a century and a half earlier by the
<i>trouv√®re</i> Rutebeuf, and by other medi√¶val writers; but all we seem to
know of it is, that the players were seated, apparently on the ground, and
that one of them was furnished with a rod or stick. We know less still
of <i>pince merille</i>. <i>Qui fery?</i> is evidently the game which was, at a later
period, called hot-cockles; and <i>tiers</i> is understood to be the game now
called blindman‚Äôs buff. These, and other games, are not unfrequently
represented in the fanciful drawings in the margins of medi√¶val illuminated
manuscripts; but as no names or descriptions are given with
these drawings, it is often very difficult to identify them. Our cut
(<a href="#n160">No. 160</a>), which is given by Strutt, from a manuscript in the Bodleian
Library at Oxford, is one of several subjects representing the game of
blindman‚Äôs buff, or, as it was formerly called in England, <i>hoodman-blind</i>,
because the person blinded had his eyes covered with a hood. It is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
here played by females, but, in other illuminations, or drawings, the
players are boys or men&mdash;the latter plainly indicated by their beards.
The word hoodman-blind is not found at an earlier period than the
Elizabethan age, yet this name, from its allusion to the costume, was
evidently older. A personage in Shakespeare (Hamlet, Act iii.
Scene 4) asks&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i12"><i>What devil was‚Äôt</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That thus hath cozen‚Äôd you at</i> hoodman-blind?<br /></span>
</span></span>

Hot-cockles seems formerly to have been a very favourite game. One of
the players was blindfolded, and knelt down, with his face on the knee
of another, and his hand held out flat behind him; the other players in
turn struck him on the hand, and he was obliged to guess at the name of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
the striker, who, if he guessed right, was compelled to take his place.
A part of the joke appears to have consisted in the hardness of the blows.
Our cut (<a href="#n161">No. 161</a>), from the Bodleian manuscript (which was written in
1344), is evidently intended to represent a party of females playing at
hot-cockles, though the damsel who plays the principal part is not blindfolded,
and she is touched on the back, and not on the hand. Our next
cut (<a href="#n162">No. 162</a>), which represents a party of shepherds and shepherdesses
engaged in the same game, is taken from a piece of Flemish tapestry, of
the fifteenth century, which is at present to be seen in the South Kensington
Museum. Allusions to this game are found in the writers of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Among the ‚Äúcommendatory
verses‚Äù to the second edition of ‚ÄúGondibert‚Äù (by William Davenant),
printed in 1653, is the following rather curious piece of wit, which
explains itself, and is, at the same time, an extremely good description of
this game:&mdash;</p>

<h3>THE POET‚ÄôS HOT-COCKLES.</h3>

<p><span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Thus poets, passing time away.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Like children at</i> hot-cockles <i>play</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>All strike by turn, and Will is strook</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>(And he lies down that writes a book)</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Have at thee, Will, for now I come,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Spread thy hand faire upon thy bomb;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For thy much insolence, bold bard,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And little sense I strike thus hard.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>‚ÄúWhose hand was that?‚Äù ‚Äú‚ÄôTwas Jaspar Mayne.‚Äù</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>‚ÄúNay, there you‚Äôre out; lie down again.‚Äù</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With Gondibert, prepare, and all</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>See where the doctor comes to maul</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The author‚Äôs hand, ‚Äôtwill make him reel;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>No, Will lies still, and does not feel.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That book‚Äôs so light, ‚Äôtis all one whether</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>You strike with that or with a feather.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But room for one, new come to town,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That strikes so hard, he‚Äôll knock him down;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The hand he knows, since it the place</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Has toucht more tender than his face;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Important sheriff, now thou lyst down,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>We‚Äôll kiss thy hands, and clap our own.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The game of hot-cockles has only become obsolete in recent times, if
it be even now quite out of use. Most readers will remember the passage
in Gay‚Äôs ‚ÄúPastorals:‚Äù&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>As at</i> hot-cockles <i>once I laid me down,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And felt the weighty hand of many a clown,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Buxoma gave a gentle tap, and I</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Quick rose, and read soft mischief in her eye</i>.<br /></span>
</span></span>

This passage is aptly illustrated by the cut from the tapestry. The
same Bodleian manuscript gives us a playful group, reproduced in our
cut <a href="#n163">No. 163</a>, which Strutt believes to be the game called, in more
modern times, ‚Äúfrog-in-the-middle.‚Äù One of the party, who played frog,
sat on the ground, while his comrades surrounded and buffeted him,
until he could catch and hold one of them, who then had to take his
place. In our cut, the players are females.</p>

<p>Games of questions and commands, and of forfeits, were also common
in medi√¶val society. Among the poems of Baudouin and Jean de Cond√©
(poets of the thirteenth century), we have a description of a game of this
kind. ‚ÄúOne time,‚Äù we are told, ‚Äúthere was play among ladies and
damsels; there were among them both clever and handsome; they took
up many games, until, at last, they elected a queen to play at <i>roy-qui-ne-ment</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
(the king who does not lie); she, whom they chose, was clever at
commands and at questions:‚Äù&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Une foi ierent en dosnoi</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Entre dames et damoiselles;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>De cointes i ot et de belles.</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Et tant c‚Äôune royne fistrent</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Et de demandes demander.</i><br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Barbazan Fabliaux, tom. i. p. 100.<br /></span>
</span></span>

The aim of the questions was, of course, to provoke answers which would
excite mirth; and the sequel of the story shows the great want of delicacy
which prevailed in medi√¶val society. Another sort of amusement was
furnished, by what may be called games of chance; in which the players,
in turn, drew a character at hazard. These characters were generally
written in verse, in burlesque and often very coarse language, and several
sets of them have been preserved in old manuscripts. They consist of
a series of alternate good and bad characters, sometimes only designed for
females, but at others for women and men: two of these sets (printed
in my ‚ÄúAnecdota Literaria‚Äù) were written in England; one, of the
thirteenth century, in Anglo-Norman, the other, of the fifteenth century,
in English. From these we learn that the game, in England, was called
Rageman, or Ragman, and that the verses, describing the characters, were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
written on a roll called Ragman‚Äôs Roll, and had strings attached to them,
by which each person drew his or her chance. The English set has a
short preface, in which the author addresses himself to the ladies, for
whose special use it was compiled:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>My ladyes and my maistresses echone,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Lyke hit unto your humbylle wommanhede</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Resave in gr√©</i> (good part) <i>of my sympille persone</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>This rolle, which withouten any drede</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Kynge Ragman me bad mesoure in brede,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And cristyned yt the meroure of your chaunce;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Draweth a strynge, and that shal streight yow leyde</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Unto the verry path of your governaunce</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
</span></span>

<i>i. e.</i> it will tell you exactly how you behave yourself, what is your
character. This game is alluded to by the poet Gower in the ‚ÄúConfessio
Amantis:‚Äù&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Venus, whiche stant withoute lawe,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In non certeyne, but as men drawe</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Of</i> Ragemon <i>upon the chaunce,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sche leyeth no peys</i> (weight) <i>in the balaunce</i>.<br /></span>
</span></span>

The ragman‚Äôs roll, when rolled up for use, would present a confused mass
of strings hanging from it, probably with bits of wax at the end, from
which the drawer had to select one. This game possesses a peculiar
historical interest. When the Scottish nobles and chieftains acknowledged
their dependence on the English crown in the reign of Edward I., the
deed by which they made this acknowledgment, having all their seals
hung to it, presented, when rolled up, much the appearance of the roll
used in this game; and hence, no doubt, they gave it in derision the
name of the <i>Ragman‚Äôs Roll</i>. Afterwards it became the custom to call any
roll with many signatures, or any long catalogue, the various headings of
which were perhaps marked by strings, by the same name. This game
of chance or fortune was continued, under other names, to a late period.
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the burlesque characters were
often inscribed on the back of roundels, which were no doubt dealt round
to the company like cards, with the inscribed side downwards.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 164. Ball-Playing.</i></p></div>

<p>Sometimes the ladies and young men indulged within doors in more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
active games&mdash;among which we may mention especially different games
with the ball, and also, perhaps, the whipping-top. We learn from many
sources that hand-ball was from a very early period a favourite recreation
with the youth of both sexes. It is a
subject not unfrequently met with in the
marginal drawings of medi√¶val manuscripts.
The annexed example (cut <a href="#n164">No. 164</a>), from
MS. Harl. No. 6563, represents apparently
two ladies playing with a ball. In
other instances, a lady and a gentleman are
similarly occupied. Our cut <a href="#n165">No. 165</a> is
taken from one of the carvings of the <i>miserere</i>
seats in Gloucester cathedral. The long
tails of the hoods belong to the costume of the latter part of the fourteenth
century. The whipping-top was also a plaything of considerable
antiquity; I think it may be traced to the Anglo-Saxon period. Our
cut <a href="#n166">No. 166</a> is taken from one of the marginal drawings of a well-known
manuscript in the British Museum (MS. Reg. 2 B. vii.) of the beginning
of the fourteenth century. It may be remarked that the knots on the
lashes merely mark a conventional manner of representing a whip, for
every boy knows that a knotted whip would not do for a top. Medi√¶val
art was full of such conventionalities.</p>

<p>Most of these recreations of young people in the middle ages were
gradually left to a still younger age, and became children‚Äôs games, and
of these the margins of the illuminated manuscripts furnish abundant
examples. One of these (taken from the margin of the Royal MS.,
10 E. iv., of the fourteenth century) will be sufficient for the present
occasion. A favourite game, during at least the later periods of the
middle ages, was that which is now called nine-pins. The French gave
it the name <i>quilles</i>, which in our language was corrupted into <i>keyles</i> and
<i>kayles</i>. The lad in our cut (<a href="#n167">No. 167</a>) is not, as at present, bowling at
the pins, but throwing with a stick, a form of the game which was called
in French the <i>jeu de quilles √† baston</i>, and in English <i>club-kayles</i>. Money
was apparently played for, and the game was looked upon as belonging
to the same class as hazard. In a series of metrical counsels to apprentices,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
compiled in the fifteenth century, and printed in the ‚ÄúReliqui√¶
Antiqu√¶,‚Äù ii. 223, they are recommended to&mdash;</p>

<p>When no gaiety was going on, the ladies of the household were employed
in occupations of a more useful description, among which the principal
were spinning, weaving, knitting, embroidering, and sewing. Almost
everything of this kind was done at home at the period of which we are
now speaking, and equally in the feudal castle or manor, and in the house
of the substantial burgher, the female part of the family spent a great
part of their time in different kinds of work in the chambers of the lady
of the household. Such work is alluded to in medi√¶val writers, from
time to time, and we find it represented in illuminated manuscripts, but
not so frequently as some of the other domestic scenes. In the romance
of the ‚ÄúDeath of Garin le Loherain,‚Äù when count Fromont visited the
chamber of fair Beatrice, he found her occupied in sewing a very
beautiful <i>chainsil</i>, or petticoat:&mdash;

<span class="i0"><i>Ele cosoit un molt riche chainsil.</i><br /></span>

</span></span>

In the romance of ‚ÄúLa Violette,‚Äù the daughter of the burgher, in whose
house the count Girard is lodged, is described as being ‚Äúone day seated
in her father‚Äôs chambers working a stole and amice in silk and gold, very
skilfully, and she made in it, with care, many a little cross and many a
star, singing all the while a <i>chanson-√†-toile</i>,‚Äù meaning, it is supposed, a
song of a grave measure, composed for the purpose of being sung by
ladies when weaving:&mdash;

In one of Rutebeuf‚Äôs fabliaux, a woman makes excuse for being up late
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
at night that she was anxious to finish a piece of linen cloth she was
weaving:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>A une toile que je fais.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

And in another fabliau, that of ‚ÄúGuillaume au Faucon,‚Äù a young ‚Äúbacheler‚Äù
entering suddenly the chamber of the ladies, finds them all occupied in
embroidering a piece of silk with the ensigns of the lord of the castle.
Embroidery, indeed, was a favourite occupation: a lady thus employed
is represented in our cut <a href="#n168">No. 168</a>, taken from a richly illuminated
manuscript of the fourteenth century, in the British Museum (MS. Reg.
2 B. vii.) The ladies, too, not only made up the cloths into dresses and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
articles of other kinds, but they were extensively employed in the various
processes of making the cloth itself. Our cut <a href="#n169">No. 169</a>, taken from a
manuscript of about the same period (MS. Reg. 10 E. iv.), represents
the process of carding the wool; and the same
manuscript furnishes us with another cut (No.
170), in which a lady appears in the employment
of spinning it into yarn. Our next cut (<a href="#n171">No. 171</a>),
taken from an illumination in an early French
translation of the Metamorphoses of Ovid (in the
National Library, MS. 6986), represents three
ladies (intended for the three Fates) employed in
these domestic occupations, and will give us a
notion of the implements they used.</p>

<p>Domestic animals, particularly dogs and birds,
were favourite companions of the ladies in their chambers. A favourite
falcon had frequently its ‚Äúperche‚Äù in a corner of the chamber; and in
the illuminations we sometimes see the lady seated with the bird on her
wrist. Birds in cages are also not unfrequently
alluded to through the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries. In the romance
of ‚ÄúLa Violette‚Äù a tame lark plays rather
an important part in the story. Our cut
No. 172, where we see two birds in a cage
together, and which is curious for the form
of the cage, is given by Willemin from a
manuscript of the fourteenth century at
Paris. The hawk, though usually kept
only for hunting, sometimes became a pet,
and persons carried their hawks on the fist
even in social parties within doors. The
jay is spoken of as a cage-bird. The parrot,
under the name of <i>papejay</i>, <i>popinjay</i>, or <i>papingay</i>, is also often spoken of
during the middle ages, although, in all probability, it was very rare. The
favourite talking-bird was the pie, or magpie, which often plays a very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
remarkable part in medi√¶val stories. The aptness of this bird for imitation
led to an exaggerated estimate of its powers, and it is frequently made to
give information to the husband of the weaknesses of his wife. Several
medi√¶val stories turn upon this supposed quality. The good chevalier
de la Tour-Landry, in his book of counsels to his daughters, composed in
the second half of the fourteenth century, tells a story of a magpie as a
warning of the danger of indulging in gluttony. ‚ÄúI will tell you,‚Äù he
says, ‚Äúa story in regard to women who eat dainty morsels in the absence
of their lords. There was a lady who had a pie in a cage, which talked
of everything which it saw done. Now it happened that the lord of the
household preserved a large eel in a pond, and kept it very carefully, in
order to give it to some of his lords or of his friends, in case they should
visit him. So it happened that the lady said to her female attendant
that it would be good to eat the great eel, and accordingly they eat it,
and agreed that they would tell their lord that the otter had eaten it.
And when the lord returned, the pie began to say to him, ‚ÄòMy lord, my
lady has eaten the eel.‚Äô Then the lord went to his pond, and missed his
eel; and he went into the house, and asked his wife what had become
of it. She thought to excuse herself easily, but he said that he knew all
about it, and that the pie had told him. The result was that there was
great quarrelling and trouble in the house; but when the lord was gone
away, the lady and her female attendant went to the pie, and plucked all
the feathers from his head, saying, ‚ÄòYou told about the eel.‚Äô And so
the poor pie was quite bald. But from that time forward, when it saw
any people who were bald or had large foreheads, the pie said to them,
‚ÄòAh! you told about the eel!‚Äô And this is a good example how no
woman ought to eat any choice morsel by gluttony without the knowledge
of her lord, unless it be to give it to people of honour; for this
lady was afterwards mocked and jeered for eating the eel, through the
pie which complained of it.‚Äù The reader will recognise in this the
origin of a much more modern story.</p>

<p>One of the stories in the celebrated medi√¶val collection, entitled
‚ÄúThe Seven Sages,‚Äù also turns upon the talkative qualities of this bird.
There was a burgher who had a pie which, on being questioned, related
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
whatever it had seen, for it spoke uncommonly well the language of the
people. Now the burgher‚Äôs wife was a good-for-nothing woman, and as
soon as her husband went from home about business, she sent for her
friend out of the town; but the pie, which was a great favourite of the
burgher, told him all the goings on when he returned, and the husband
knew that it always spoke the truth. So he became acquainted with his
wife‚Äôs conduct. One day the burgher went from home, and told his wife
he should not return that night, and she immediately sent for her friend;
but he was afraid to enter, for ‚Äúthe pie was hung up in his cage on a
high perch in the middle of the porch of the house.‚Äù Encouraged, however,
by the lady, the friend ventured in, and passed through the hall to
the chamber. The pie, which saw him pass, and knew him well on
account of some tricks he had played upon it, called out, ‚ÄúAh, sir! you
who are in the chamber there, why don‚Äôt you pay your visits when the
master is at home?‚Äù It said no more all the day, but the lady set her
wits to work for a stratagem to avert the danger. So when night came,
she called her chamber-maiden, and gave her a great jug full of water,
and a lighted candle, and a wooden mallet, and about midnight the
maiden mounted on the top of the house, and began to beat with the
mallet on the laths, and from time to time showed the light through
the crevices, and threw the water right down upon the pie till the bird
was wet all over. Next morning the husband came home, and began to
question his pie. ‚ÄúSir,‚Äù it said, ‚Äúmy lady‚Äôs friend has been here, and
stayed all night, and is only just gone away. I saw him go.‚Äù Then the
husband was very angry, and was going to quarrel with his wife, but
the pie went on&mdash;‚ÄúSir, it has thundered and lightened all night, and
the rain was so heavy that I have been wet through.‚Äù ‚ÄúNay,‚Äù said the
husband, ‚Äúit has been fine all night, without rain or storm.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou see,‚Äù
said the crafty dame, ‚Äúyou see how much your bird is to be believed.
Why should you put more faith in him when he tells tales about me,
than when he talks so knowingly about the weather?‚Äù Then the burgher
thought he had been deceived, and turning his wrath upon the pie, drew
it from the cage and twisted its neck; but he had no sooner done so than,
looking up, he saw how the laths had been deranged. So he got a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
ladder, mounted on the roof, and discovered the whole mystery. If, says
the story, he had not been so hasty, the life of his bird would have been
saved. In the English version of this series of tales, printed by Weber,
the pie‚Äôs cage is made to hang in the hall:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The burgeis hadde a pie in his halle,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That couthe telle tales alle</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Apertlich</i> (openly), <i>in French langage,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And heng in a faire cage</i>.<br /></span>
</span></span>

In the other English version, edited by the author of this work for the
Percy Society, the bird is said to have been, not a pie, but a ‚Äúpopynjay,‚Äù
or parrot, and there are other variations in it which show that it had been
taken more directly from the Oriental original, in which, as might be
expected, the bird is a parrot.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 173. Lady and Dog.</i></p></div>

<p>Among the animals mentioned as pets we sometimes find monkeys.
One of the Latin stories in the collection printed
by the Percy Society, tells how a rustic, entering
the hall of a certain nobleman, seeing a monkey
dressed in the same suit as the nobleman‚Äôs family,
and supposing, as its back was turned, that it was
one of his sons, began to address it with all suitable
reverence; but when he saw that it was only a
monkey chattering at him, he exclaimed, ‚ÄúA curse
upon you! I thought you had been Jenkin, my
lord‚Äôs son.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> The favourite quadruped, however,
has always been the dog, of which several kinds are
mentioned as lady‚Äôs pets. Chaucer tells us of his prioress,&mdash;

Our cut <a href="#n173">No. 173</a>, from a manuscript of the St. Graal, in the British
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
Museum (MS. Addit. No. 10,293, fol. 31), written in the thirteenth
century, represents a queen seated in conversation, with her dog in her
lap. The next cut (<a href="#n174">No. 174</a>), from an illumination in the interesting
manuscript of the Roman de Meliadus in the British Museum (MS.
Addit. 12,228, fol. 310), belonging to the latter half of the fourteenth
century (the reign of our Edward III.), represents the interior of a
chamber, with two little dogs gamboling about. In the singular work
on domestic economy, entitled the ‚ÄúM√©nagier de Paris,‚Äù written about the
year 1393, the lady of the household is particularly recommended to think
of the ‚Äúchamber beasts,‚Äù such as little dogs, the ‚Äúchamber birds,‚Äù &amp;c.,
inasmuch as these creatures, not having the gift of speech, could not ask
for themselves.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> I have printed in the ‚ÄúReliqui√¶ Antiqu√¶‚Äù a curious
Anglo-Norman poem, of the beginning of the fourteenth century, written
as a satire on the ladies of the time, who were too fond of their dogs, and
fed them delicately, while the servants were left to short commons
(Reliq. Antiq. vol. i. p. 155). Cats are seldom mentioned as pets,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
except of ill-famed old women. There was a prejudice against them in
the middle ages, and they were joined in people‚Äôs imagination with
witchcraft, and with other diabolical agencies.
The accompanying group of an old lady and her
cats (cut <a href="#n175">No. 175</a>) is taken from a carving on one
of the <i>misereres</i> in the church of Minster, in the
Isle of Thanet. Curiously enough, the English
‚ÄúRule of Nuns,‚Äù of the earlier half of the thirteenth
century, forbids the nuns to keep any
‚Äúbeast‚Äù but a cat.</p>

<p>The chamber was, as might be expected,
more comfortably furnished than the hall. The
walls were covered with curtains, or tapestry,
whence this apartment is frequently termed in
the fabliaux and romances the <i>chambre encortin√©e</i>. The story of a fabliau
printed in my ‚ÄúAnecdota Literaria‚Äù turns upon the facility with which a
person might be concealed behind the ‚Äúcurtains‚Äù of the chamber. Besides
a bench or stool to sit upon, there was usually a chair in the chamber.
In the fabliau of the Bouchier d‚ÄôAbbeville, the priest‚Äôs lady, when she rises
out of bed to dress, is represented as placing herself in a chair&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>En le caiere s‚Äôest assisse.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

In the early English romance of ‚ÄúHorn,‚Äù the lady, receiving a gentleman
into her chamber, gives him a rich chair which would hold seven people,
and which is covered, in true regal style, with a baldekin:&mdash;</p>

<p>The chamber was especially distinguished by its fireplace and chimney.
The form of the medi√¶val fireplace is well-known from the numerous
examples still remaining in the chambers of our old castles and mansion
houses. The fire was made on the hearth, upon iron dogs, which had
often very ornamental forms. The old romances frequently represent
people sitting round the chamber fireplace to hold private conversation.
It was here also that the heads of the family, or individual members of it
in their own chambers, assembled in the evening when no ceremonious
feasting was going on. In a story in the text of the ‚ÄúSeven Sages,‚Äù
printed by Weber, a young married woman is represented sitting in the
evening with her lord by the chamber fireside, attended by their squire,
and playing with a dog&mdash;

In ‚ÄúGautier d‚ÄôAupais,‚Äù when the young damsel sends for her mother,
her messenger finds the old lady sitting on a richly-worked counterpoint
by a coal fire (probably of charcoal)&mdash;

</span></span>

In the romance of ‚ÄúSir Degrevant,‚Äù when the lady Myldore has sent for
her lover to come privately to her chamber at night, she orders her
maiden to prepare a fire, and place fagots of fir-wood to keep it burning&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

</span></span>

A board is placed on trestles to form a table, and a dainty supper is served,
which the lady carves for her lover, and she further treats him with rich
wines. In the romance of ‚ÄúQueen Berthe‚Äù (p. 102), three persons,
holding a secret consultation in the chamber of one of their party, sit on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
carpets (<i>sur les tapis</i>); but these were no doubt embroidered cloths thrown
over the seats. Floor-carpets were sometimes used in the chambers, but
this was uncommon, and they seem to have been more usually, like the hall,
strewed with rushes. It appears that sometimes, as a refinement in gaiety,
flowers were mixed with the rushes. In a fabliau in Meon (i. 75), a lady
who expects her lover, lights a fire in the chamber, and spreads rushes and
flowers on the floor&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Vient √† l‚Äôostel, lo feu esclaire,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Jons et flors espandre par l‚Äôaire.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

There was an <i>escrin</i>, or cabinet, which stood against the wall, which was
often so large that a man might conceal himself behind it. The plot of
several medi√¶val stories turns upon this circumstance. Chests and coffers
were also kept in the chamber; and it contained generally a small table,
or at least the board and trestles for making one, which the lord or lady
of the house used when they would dine or sup in private. The practice
of thus dining or supping privately in the chamber is not unfrequently
alluded to in the old stories and romances.</p>

<p>Supper, however, being the second meal in the day at which the
whole household met together, was generally a more public one, and was
held, like the dinner, in the hall, and with much the same forms and
services. It was preceded and closed by the same washing of hands, and
the table was almost as plentifully covered with viands. After having
washed, the company drank round, and it seems to have been the usual
custom, on leaving the supper-table, to go immediately to bed, for people
in general kept early hours. Thus, in one of the pious stories printed by
Meon, in describing a royal supper-party, we are told that, ‚Äúwhen they
had eaten and washed, they drunk, and then went to bed‚Äù&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Qant orent mengi√©, si laverent,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Puis burent, et couchier alerent.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

And in another story in the same collection, the lady receives a stranger
to supper in a very hospitable manner&mdash;‚Äúwhen they had eaten leisurely,
then it was time to go to bed‚Äù&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Qant orent mengi√© par loisir,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Si su heure d‚Äôaler gesir.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>

Sometimes, however, there were dancing and other amusements between
supper and bed-time. Thus, in the romance of ‚ÄúSir Degrevant,‚Äù&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Bleve</i> (quickly) <i>to soper they dyght,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Both squiere and knyght;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>They daunsed and revelide that nyght,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>In hert were they blythe</i>.<br /></span>
</span></span>

In a fabliau published by Barbazan, on the arrival in a nobleman‚Äôs castle
of a knight who is treated with especial courtesy, the knights and ladies
dance after supper, and then, at bed-time, they conduct the visitor into
his bed-chamber, and drink with him there before they leave him:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Apr√®s mengier, chascuns comence</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>De faire caroles et dance,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tant qu‚Äôil fu houre de couchier;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Puis anmainment le chevalier</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>En sa chambre o√π fait fu son lit,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Et l√† burent par grant delit;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Puis prinrent congi√©.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

Fruit was usually eaten after supper. In a fabliau of the thirteenth
century, a noble visitor having been received in the house of a knight,
they go immediately to supper. ‚ÄúAfter they had done eating, they
enjoyed themselves in conversation, and then they had fruit,‚Äù and it was
only after this that they washed&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Apr√®s mengier se sont deduit</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>De paroles, puis si ont fruit.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

In the lay of the ‚ÄúChevalier √† l‚ÄôEsp√©e,‚Äù Sir Gauwain takes, instead of
supper, fruit and wine before he goes to bed.</p>

<p>The custom of keeping early hours still prevailed, and is very frequently
alluded to. People are generally described as rising with the sun. Such
was the case with the king, in the romance of ‚ÄúParise la Duchesse‚Äù&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Landemain par matin, quand solaus fu levez,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Se leva li rois Hugues.</i><br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Parise, ed. P. Paris, p. 219.<br /></span>
</span></span>

It was the custom, after rising, to attend service either in the church or
in the private chapel. In the history of Fulke Fitz-Warine, Jose de
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
Dynan, in his castle of Ludlow, rose early in the morning, heard service
in the chapel, after which he mounted to the top of the loftiest tower, to
take a view of the country around, then descended and ‚Äúcaused the horn
to be sounded for washing.‚Äù This was no doubt the signal for the household
to assemble for breakfast. In Chaucer‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquyeres Tale,‚Äù the
king‚Äôs guests, after great feasting and carousing at night, sleep till ‚Äúprime
large‚Äù in the morning, that is till six o‚Äôclock, which is spoken of in a
manner which evidently intimates that they had considerably overslept
themselves. The princess Canace had left her bed long before, and was
walking with her maidens in the park. In the ‚ÄúSchipmannes Tale,‚Äù too,
the lady rises very early in the morning, and takes her walk in the garden.
In the curious ‚ÄúBook‚Äù of the Chevalier de la Tour Landry, we are told
of a very pious dame whom he knew, whose daily life was as follows:&mdash;She
rose early in the morning, had two friars and two or three chaplains
in attendance to chant matins while she was rising; as soon as she left
her chamber she went to her chapel, and remained in devotion in her
oratory while they said matins and one mass, and then she went and
dressed and arrayed herself, after which she went to recreate herself in
the garden or about the house; she then attended divine service again,
and after it went to dinner; and during the afternoon she visited the sick,
and in due time supped, and after supper she called her <i>ma√Ætre d‚Äôh√¥tel</i>,
and made her household arrangements for the following day.</p>

<p>The hour of breakfast is very uncertain, and appears not to have been
fixed. The hour of dinner was, as already stated, nine o‚Äôclock in the
morning, or sometimes ten. In the lay of the ‚ÄúMantel Mautaill√©,‚Äù king
Arthur is introduced on a grand festival day refusing, according to his
custom, to begin the dinner till some ‚Äúadventure‚Äù occurs, and the guests
wait till near ‚Äúnonne,‚Äù when the grand seneschal, Sir Keux, takes upon
himself to expostulate, and represents that dinner had been ready a long
time (<i>pie√ß√†</i>). <i>Nonne</i> is here probably meant for midday, or noon. The
queen was in her chamber, greatly distressed at having to wait so long for
dinner. The regular hour of supper appears to have been five o‚Äôclock in
the afternoon, but when private it seems not to have been fixed to any
particular hour. In summer, at least, people appear usually to have gone
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
to bed when darkness approached; and this was the time at which guests
ordinarily took their leave. Thus, at January‚Äôs wedding-feast, in Chaucer,
we are told that&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Night, with his mantel, that is dark and rude,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Gan oversprede themesperie aboute;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For which departed is the lusti route</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fro January, with thank on every side,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hoom to her houses lustily thay ryde.</i><br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Cant. Tales, l. 9672.<br /></span>
</span></span>

We must not forget that these remarks apply to the seasons of the year
when days were long, for the scenes of most of these romances and tales
are laid in the spring and summer months, and especially in May. We
have much less information on the domestic relations during winter.</p>

<div class="figright"><img id="n176" src="images/i_n176.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 176. A Supper.</i></p></div>

<p>One reason for keeping early hours was that candles and lamps were
too expensive to be used in profusion by people in general. Various
methods of giving artificial light at night are
mentioned, most of which seem to have been
considered more or less as luxuries. At grand
festivals the light was often given by men holding
torches. In general, candles were used at
supper. The accompanying cut (<a href="#n176">No. 176</a>),
taken from the manuscript of the St. Graal
already mentioned, represents a person supping by
candlelight. In the fabliau of ‚ÄúLa Borgoise d‚ÄôOrliens,‚Äù a lady, receiving
her lover into her chamber, spreads a table for him, and lights a great
wax candle (<i>grosse chandoile de cire</i>).</p>

<p>Lighting in the middle ages was, indeed, effected, in a manner more
or less refined, by means of torches, lamps, and candles. The candle,
which was the most portable of them all, was employed in small and
private evening parties; and, from an early period, it was used in the
bed-chamber. For the table very handsome candlesticks were made,
which were employed by people of rank, and wax-candles (<i>cierges</i>) were
used on them. They were formed with an upright spike (<i>broche</i>), on
which the candle was stuck, not, as now, placed in a socket. Thus, in a
scene in one of the fabliaux printed by Barbazan, a good <i>bourgeois</i> has on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
his supper-table two candlesticks of silver, ‚Äúvery fair and handsome,‚Äù
with wax-candles&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Desor la table ot deus broissins,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>O√π il avoit cierges, d‚Äôargent,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Molt estoient bel et gent.</i><br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Barbazan, vol. iv. p. 184.<br /></span>
</span></span>

So in the romance of ‚ÄúLa Violette,‚Äù when the count Lisiart arrives at
the castle of duke Gerart, on the approach of bedtime, two men-servants
make their appearance, each carrying a lighted <i>cierge</i>, or wax-candle,
and thus they lead him to his chamber&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Atant lor vinrent doi sergant,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Chascuns tenoit j. cerge ardant;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Le conte menerent couchier.</i><br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;La Violette, p. 30.<br /></span>
</span></span>

This, however, appears to have been done as a mark of honour to the
guest, for, even in ducal castles common candles appear to have been in
ordinary use. In a bedroom scene in a fabliau printed by Meon (tom. i.
p. 268), in which the younger ladies of the duke‚Äôs family and their
female attendants slept all in beds in one room, they have but one candle
(<i>chandoile</i>), and that is attached to the wood of the bed of the duke‚Äôs
daughter, so that it would appear to have had no candlestick. One of
the damsels, who was a stranger, and less familiar than the others, was
unwilling to take off her chemise until the light was extinguished, for it
must be remembered that it was the general custom to sleep in bed quite
naked, and the daughter of the duke, whose bedfellow she was to be,
blew the candle out&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Roseite tantost la soufla,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Qu‚Äô√† s‚Äôesponde estoit atachie.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

Blowing out the candle was the ordinary manner of extinguishing it. In
the ‚ÄúM√©nagier de Paris,‚Äù or instructions for the management of a gentleman‚Äôs
household, compiled in the latter half of the fourteenth century,
the lady of the house is told, after having each night ascertained that the
house is properly closed and all the fires covered, to see all the servants to
bed, and to take care that each had a candle in a ‚Äúflat-bottomed candlestick,‚Äù
at some distance from the bed, ‚Äúand to teach them prudently to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
extinguish their candles before they go into their bed with the mouth,
or with the hand, and not with their chemise,‚Äù <i>i. e.</i>, they were to blow
their candle out, or put it out with their fingers, not to extinguish it by
throwing their shifts upon it&mdash;another allusion to the practice of sleeping
naked.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> Extinguishers had not yet come into general use. People went
to bed with a candle placed in a candlestick of a different description
from that used at table; and we learn from a story in the ‚ÄúM√©nagier de
Paris‚Äù that it was customary for the servant or servants who had charge
of the candles, to accompany them into their bedroom, remain with
them till they were in bed, and then carry the candles away. Candles
were, however, usually left in the chamber or bedroom all night;
and there was frequently a spike, or candlestick, attached to the chimney;
as in the fabliau just quoted there was, no doubt, a similar spike
attached to the wood-work of the bed. The stick, whether fixed or
movable, was made for convenience in placing the candle in the
chamber, and not for the purpose of carrying it about; for the latter
purpose, it appears to have been generally taken off the stick, and carried
in the hand. Our cut <a href="#n177">No. 177</a>, taken from one of the carved stalls of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
the chapel of Winchester school, represents an individual, perhaps the
cellarer or steward, who has gone into the cellar with a candle, which he
carries in this manner, and is there terrified by the appearance of hobgoblins.
In the fabliau of the ‚ÄúChevalier √† la Corbeille,‚Äù an old due√±a,
employed to watch over her young mistress, being disturbed in the night,
is obliged to take her candle, and go into the kitchen to light it; from
whence we may suppose that it was the custom to keep the kitchen fire
in all night.</p>

<p>An old poem on the troubles of housekeeping, printed by M. Jubinal
in his ‚ÄúNouveau Recueil de Contes,‚Äù enumerates
candles and a lantern among the necessaries of a household&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Or faut chandeles et lanterne.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

A manuscript of the thirteenth century in the French
National Library (No. 6956) contains an illumination,
which has furnished us with the accompanying cut
(<a href="#n178">No. 178</a>), representing a man holding a lantern of the
form then in use, and lanterns are not unfrequently
mentioned in old writers.</p>

<p>It appears to have been a common custom, at least
among the better classes of society, to keep a lamp in the chamber to
give light during the night. In one of the fabliaux printed in Meon,
a man entering the chamber of a knight‚Äôs lady, finds it lit by a lamp
which was usually left burning in it&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Une lampe avoit en la chambre,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Par costume ardoir i siaut.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

In the English romance of ‚ÄúSir Eglamour,‚Äù several lamps are described as
burning in a lady‚Äôs chamber&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Aftur sopur, as y yow telle,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He wendyd to chaumbur with Crystyabelle,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>There laumpus were brennyng bryght.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

We may suppose, notwithstanding these words, that a lamp gave but a
dim light; and accordingly we are told in another fabliau that there was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
little light, or, as it is expressed in the original, ‚Äúnone,‚Äù in a chamber
where nothing but a lamp was burning,&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>En la chambre lumiere n‚Äôot,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hors d‚Äôun mortier qu‚Äôiluec ardoit,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Point de clart√© ne lor rendoit.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

In the accompanying cut (<a href="#n179">No. 179</a>), taken from an illumination in a
manuscript of the fourteenth century, in the National Library in Paris
(No. 6988), a nun, apparently, is arranging her lamp before going
to bed. The lamp here consists of a little basin of oil, in which, no
doubt, the wick floated; but the use of the stand under it is not easily
explained.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n179" src="images/i_n179.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 179. A Bedroom Chamber Scene.</i></p></div>

<p>Lamps were used where a light was wanted in a room for a long
time, because they lasted longer without requiring snuffing. The lamps
of the middle ages were made usually on the plan of those of the Romans,
consisting, as in the foregoing example, of a small vessel of earthenware
or metal, which was filled with oil, and a wick placed in it. This lamp
was placed on a stand, or was sometimes suspended on a beam, or perch,
or against the wall. We have an example of this in the preceding cut
(<a href="#n179">No. 179</a>), which explains the term <i>mortier</i> (mortar) of the fabliau, it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
was a wick swinging in oil in a basin. Our cut <a href="#n180">No. 180</a>, taken from a
manuscript of the fourteenth century in the British Museum (MS. Harl.,
No. 1227), represents a row of lamps of rather curious form, made to be
suspended. In our next cut (<a href="#n181">No. 181</a>), from a manuscript of the same
date (MS. Reg. 2 B. vii.), we have lamps of a somewhat similar form,
made to be carried in the hand.</p>

<p>Torches were used at greater festivals, and for occasions where it was
necessary to give light to very large halls full of company. They were
usually held in the hand by servants, but were sometimes placed against
the wall in holds made to receive them. Torches were not unfrequently
used to give light to the chamber also. In one of the stories of the
‚ÄúSeven Sages,‚Äù a man, bringing a person in secret to the king‚Äôs chamber,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
‚Äúblewe out the torche,‚Äù in order to cause perfect darkness (Weber,
iii. 63); and in the early English romance of ‚ÄúSir Degrevant‚Äù (Weber,
iii. 213), where light is wanted in a lady‚Äôs chamber, it is obtained by
means of the torches.</p>

<p>There were other means of giving light, on a still greater scale, which
I shall describe in a subsequent chapter, when treating of the fifteenth
century.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> was now a matter of pride to have the bed furnished with handsome
curtains and coverings. Curtains to beds were so common, that
being ‚Äúunder the curtain‚Äù was used as an ordinary periphrasis for being
in bed; but these curtains appear to have been suspended to the ceiling
of the chamber, with the bedhead behind them. With regard to the
bed itself, there was now much more refinement than when it was
simply stuffed with straw. Beds among the rich were made with down
(<i>duvet</i>); in the ‚ÄúRoman de la Violette‚Äù we are told of a bed made of
<i>bofu</i>&mdash;perhaps of flocks. From the vocabulary composed by Alexander
Neckam early in the thirteenth century, we learn that the bed was
covered much in the same way as at present. First, a ‚Äúquilte‚Äù was
spread over the bed; on this the bolster was placed; over this was laid a
‚Äúquilte poynt√©‚Äù or ‚Äúray√©‚Äù (<i>courtepointe</i>, or counterpane); and on this,
at the head of the bed, was placed the pillow. The sheets were then
thrown over it, and the whole was covered with a coverlet, the common
material of which, according to Neckam, was green say, though richer
materials, and even valuable furs, were used for this purpose. In the
‚ÄúLai del D√©sir√©,‚Äù we are told of a quilt (<i>coilte</i>), made in checker-wise, of
pieces of two different sorts of rich stuff, which seems to have been considered
as something extremely magnificent&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sur on bon lit s‚Äôert apui√©e;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>La coilte fu √† eschekers</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>De deus pailles ben faiz e chers.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among all classes the appearance of the bed seems to have been a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
subject of considerable pride, no doubt from the circumstance of the bedroom
being a place for receiving visitors. There were sometimes two or
more beds in the same room, and visitors slept in the same chamber with
the host and hostess. Beds were also made for the occasion, without
bedsteads, sometimes in the hall, at others in the chamber beside the
ordinary bed, or in some other room. The plots of many medi√¶val
stories turn on these circumstances. People therefore kept extra materials
for making the beds. In the ‚ÄúRoman du Meunier d‚ÄôArleux,‚Äù when a
maiden comes as an unexpected visitor, a place is chosen for her by the
side of the fire, and a soft bed is laid down, with very expensive sheets,
and a coverlet ‚Äúwarm and furred‚Äù&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Kieute mole, linchex molt chier,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Et covertoir chaut et forr√©.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One custom continued to prevail during the whole of this period,&mdash;that
of sleeping in bed entirely naked. So many allusions to this practice
occur in the old writers, that it is hardly necessary to say more than state
the fact. Not unfrequently this custom is still more strongly expressed by
stating that people went to bed as naked as they were born; as in some
moral lines in the ‚ÄúReliqui√¶ Antiqu√¶‚Äù (ii. 15), against the pride of the
ladies, who are told that, however gay may be their clothing during the
day, they will lie in bed at night as naked as they were born. It is true
that in some instances in the illuminations persons are seen in bed with
some kind of clothing on, but this was certainly an exception to the rule,
and there is generally some particular reason for it. Thus, in the ‚ÄúRoman
de la Violette‚Äù (p. 31), the lady Oriant excites the surprise of her due√±a
by going to bed in a <i>chemise</i>, and is obliged to explain her reason for so
singular a practice, namely, her desire to conceal a mark on her body.
Our cut <a href="#n182">No. 182</a>, taken from the romance of the St. Graal, in the British
Museum (MS. Addit. No. 10,292, fol. 21, v<sup>o</sup>), represents a king and
queen in bed, both naked. The crowns on their heads are a mere conventional
method of stating their rank: kings and queens were not in
the habit of sleeping in bed with their crowns on their heads. In the
next cut (<a href="#n183">No. 183</a>), taken from a manuscript of the romance of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
‚ÄúQuatre Fils d‚ÄôAymon,‚Äù of the latter part of the fourteenth century, in
the National Library in Paris (No. 6970), there is still less room left for
doubt on the subject. The people seem to be sleeping in a public
hostelry, where the beds are made in recesses, not unlike the berths in a
modern steamer; the man on horseback is supposed to be outside, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
his arrival has given alarm to a man who was in bed, and who is escaping
without any kind of clothing. In the English romance of ‚ÄúSir Isumbras,‚Äù
the castle of Isumbras is burnt to the ground in the night, and his lady
and three children escaped from their beds; when he hurried to the spot,
he found them without clothing or shelter&mdash;

Curiously enough, while so little care was taken to cover the body, the
head was carefully covered at night, not with a nightcap, but with a
kerchief (<i>couvrechief</i>), which was wrapped round it.</p>

<p>The practice of warm-bathing prevailed very generally in all classes of
society, and is frequently alluded to in the medi√¶val romances and stories.
For this purpose a large bathing-tub was used, the ordinary form of
which is represented in the annexed cut (<a href="#n184">No. 184</a>), taken from the
manuscript of the St. Graal, of the thirteenth century, in the British
Museum (MS. Addit. No. 10,292, fol. 266). People sometimes bathed
immediately after rising in the morning; and we find the bath used after
dinner, and before going to bed. A bath was also often prepared for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
visitor on his arrival from a journey; and, what seems still more singular,
in the numerous stories of amorous intrigues, the two lovers usually begin
their interviews by bathing together.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img id="n185" src="images/i_n185.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 185. Lady at her Toilette.</i></p></div>

<p>Our cut <a href="#n185">No. 185</a>, from another volume of the manuscript last quoted
(MS. Addit. No. 10,293, fol. 266), represents a lady at her toilette. It
is a subject on which our information at
this period is not very abundant. The
round mirror of metal which she is employing
was the common form during the
middle ages, and was no doubt derived
from the ancients. The details of the
ladies‚Äô toilette are not often described, but
the contemporary moralists and satirists
condemn, in rather general terms, and evidently with more bitterness
than was called for, the pains taken by the ladies to adorn their
persons. They are accused of turning their bodies from their natural
form by artificial means, alluding to the use of stays, which appear
to have been first employed by the Anglo-Norman ladies in the twelfth
century. They are further accused of plucking out superfluous hairs from
their faces and eyebrows, of dyeing their hair, and of painting their faces.
The chevalier de la Tour-Landry (chap. 76) tells his daughters that the
whole intrigue between king David and the wife of Uriah arose out of
the circumstance of the lady combing her hair at an open window where
she could be seen from without, and says that it was a punishment for the
too great attention she gave to the adornment of her head. The toilette
of the day seems to have been completed at the first rising from bed in
the morning. There are some picturesque lines in the English metrical
romance of ‚ÄúAlisaunder,‚Äù which describe the morning thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>In a moretyde</i> (morrow-tide) <i>hit was;</i><br /></span>

<span class="author">&mdash;Weber, i. 169.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The chamber, as it has been already intimated, was properly speaking
the women‚Äôs apartment, though it was very accessible to the other sex.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
It was usually the place for private conversation, and we often hear of
persons entering the chamber for this purpose, and in this case the bed
seems to have served usually for a seat. Thus, in the romance of
‚ÄúEglamour,‚Äù when, after supper, Christabelle led the knight into her
chamber&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>That lady was not for to hyde,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sche sett hym on hur beddys syde,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>And welcomyd home thet knyght.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

Again, in a fabliau printed by Meon, a woman of a lower grade, wishing
to make a private communication to a man, invites him into her chamber,
and they sit on the bed to converse&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>En une chanbre andui en vont,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Desor un lit asis se sont.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

And in the fabliau of ‚ÄúGuillaume au Faucon,‚Äù printed by Barbazan,
Guillaume, visiting the lady of a knight in her chamber, finds her seated
on the bed, and he immediately takes a seat by her side to converse with
her. In the illuminated manuscripts, scenes of this kind occur frequently;
but in the fourteenth century, instead of being seated on the
bed, the persons thus conversing sit on a bench which runs along the side
of the bed, and seems to belong to the bedstead. A scene of this kind is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
represented in our cut <a href="#n186">No. 186</a> (taken from a manuscript of the romance
of ‚ÄúMeliadus,‚Äù in the British Museum, MS. Addit. No. 12,228, fol. 312),
which is a good representation of a bed of the fourteenth century. A
lady has introduced a king into her chamber, and they are conversing
privately, seated on the bench of the bed. In some of these illuminations,
the persons conversing are seated on the bed, with their feet on
the bench.</p>

<p>The illuminators had not yet learned the art of representing things in
detail, and they still too often give us mere conventional representations
of beds, yet we see enough to convince us that the bedsteads were already
made much more elaborately than formerly. Besides the bench at the
side, we find them now with a hutch (<i>huche</i>) or locker at the foot, in
which the possessor was accustomed to lock up his money and other
valuables. This hutch at the foot of the bed is often mentioned in the
fabliaux and romances. Thus, in the fabliau ‚ÄúDu chevalier √† la Robe
Vermeille,‚Äù a man, when he goes to bed, places his robe on a hutch at
the foot of the bed&mdash;

Another, having extorted some money from a priest, immediately puts it
in the hutch&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Les deniers a mis en la huche.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The hutch was indeed one of the most important articles of furniture in
the medi√¶val chamber. All portable objects of intrinsic value or utility
were kept in boxes, because they were thus ready for moving and taking
away in case of danger, and because in travelling people carried much of
their movables of this description about with them. Hence the uses of
the hutch or chest were very numerous and diversified. It was usual
to keep clothes of every description in a chest, and illustrations of this
practice are met with not uncommonly in the illuminated manuscripts.
One of them is given in our cut <a href="#n187">No. 187</a>, taken from an illumination in
a manuscript of the fourteenth century, given by Willemin. Jewels,
plate, personal ornaments of all kinds, and
all descriptions of ‚Äútreasure,‚Äù were similarly
locked up in chests. In our cut
No. 188, taken also from a manuscript in
the British Museum (MS. Reg. 2 B. vii.,
of the beginning of the fourteenth century),
a man appears in the act of depositing
in a chest fibul√¶ or brooches, rings,
buttons, and other objects, and a large
vessel probably of silver. Our cut No.
189, from a manuscript in the National
Library in Paris (No. 6956), represents a
miser examining the money in his hutch,
which is here detached from a bed; but
in some other illuminations, a hutch of much the same form appears
attached to the bed foot. In Anglo-Saxon the coffer was called a <i>loc</i>,
whence our word <i>locker</i> is derived; or a <i>cyste</i>, our <i>chest</i>; or an <i>arc</i>:
from the Anglo-Normans we derive the words <i>hutch</i> (<i>huche</i>) and <i>coffer</i>
(<i>coffre</i>). The Anglo-Saxons, as we have shown in a former chapter
(p. 79), like our forefathers of a later period, kept their treasures in
lockers or hutches. In the ‚ÄúLegend of St. Juliana,‚Äù an Anglo-Saxon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
poem in the Exeter Book, it is remarked in proof of the richness of a
chieftain:&mdash;</p>

<p>Among the Anglo-Saxons the lady of the household had the charge
of the coffers. In one of the laws of Cnut relating to robberies, it is
declared that ‚Äúif any man bring a stolen thing home to his cot, and he
be detected, it is just that the owner have what he went for; and unless
it has been brought under his wife‚Äôs key-lockers (<i>c√¶g-locan</i>), let her be
clear; for it is her duty to keep the keys of them, namely, her storehouse
(<i>hord-ern</i>), and her chest (<i>cyste</i>), and her box (<i>tege</i>).‚Äù (Cnut‚Äôs Laws,
No. 180.)</p>

<p>In the old metrical romances, when a town is taken and sacked, the
plunderers are described as hurrying to the chambers, to rifle the chests
and coffers, which were kept there. Thus, in the romance of the ‚ÄúMort
de Garin,‚Äù when Fromont‚Äôs town is taken by the followers of the hero
of the romance, ‚Äúthe Lorrains,‚Äù we are told, ‚Äúhastened to destroy the
town; there you might see many a chamber broken open, and many a
hutch burst and torn, where they found robes, and silver, and glittering
gold‚Äù&mdash;

So in the romance of ‚ÄúGarin,‚Äù of which that just quoted is the sequel,

Money was, indeed, commonly kept in the huche or coffer. In the
fabliau of ‚ÄúConstant Duhamel,‚Äù when Constant is threatened by the
forester, who had detained his oxen on the pretence that they had been
found trespassing, he tells him that he was ready to redeem them, as he
had a hundred sols of money in his hutch by his bed&mdash;

In the accompanying cut (<a href="#n190">No. 190</a>), from a manuscript of the fourteenth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
century in the British Museum (MS. Reg. 10 E. iv.), Joseph is
represented counting out the money from his <i>huche</i>, to buy up the corn
of Egypt, during the years of plenty.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img id="n191" src="images/i_n191.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 191. Sitting on the Huche.</i></p></div>

<p>The chests were kept in the chambers, as being the most retired and
secure part of the house, and, from the terms in which the breaking open
of the chambers is spoken of in the foregoing extracts, we are led to
suppose that the chambers themselves were usually locked. The ordinary
place for the chests or hutches, or, at least, of the principal chest, was by
the side, or more usually at the foot, of the bed. We have just seen that
this was the place in which Constant Duhamel kept his <i>huche</i>. Under
these circumstances it was very commonly used for a seat, and is often
introduced as such, both in the literature of the middle ages, and in the
illuminations of the manuscripts. In the romance of ‚ÄúGarin‚Äù (tom. i.
p. 214), the king‚Äôs messenger finds the
count of Flanders, Fromont, in a tent,
according to one manuscript, seated on
a coffer (<i>sor un coffre o√π se sist</i>). So,
also, in the ‚ÄúRoman de la Violette,‚Äù
p. 25, the heroine and her treacherous
guest are represented as seated upon
‚Äúa coffer banded with copper‚Äù (<i>sor j.
coffre bend√© de coivre</i>). Our cut <a href="#n191">No. 191</a>,
taken from one of the engravings in the
great work of Willemin, represents a
scribe thus seated on a coffer or <i>huche</i>, and engaged apparently in writing
a letter. Our next cut (<a href="#n192">No. 192</a>), taken from a manuscript of the fourteenth
century in the British Museum (MS. Reg. 15 E. vi.), represents
a lady and gentleman, seated on apparently a coffer, the former of whom
is presenting a ring to the other.</p>

<p>This latter object, the ring, acts also a very frequent and very important
part in the social history of the middle ages. A ring was often given
as a token of affection between lovers, as may perhaps be intended by the
subject of our last cut, or between relatives or friends. In the romance
of ‚ÄúWidukind,‚Äù tom. ii. p. 20, the queen gives her ring to her lover in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
a secret interview in her tent. So, in the romance of ‚ÄúHorn,‚Äù the lady
Rigmel gave her lover, Horn, a ring as a token. It was often, moreover,
given not merely as a token of remembrance, but as a means of recognition.
In the well-known early English romance of ‚ÄúSir Tristram,‚Äù
the mother of the hero, dying in childbirth of him after his father had
been slain, gives a ring to the knight to whose care she entrusted the
infant, as a token by which his parentage should be known when he
grew up:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>A ring of riche hewe</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Than hadde that levedi</i> (lady) <i>fre;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sche toke</i> (gave) <i>it Rouhand trewe,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Hir sone schie bad it be;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Mi brother wele it knewe,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Mi fader yaf it me</i>.<br /></span>
</span></span>

This ring leads subsequently to the recognition of Tristram by his uncle,
king Mark. In the romance of ‚ÄúIpomydon‚Äù (Weber‚Äôs ‚ÄúMetrical
Romances,‚Äù vol. ii. p. 355), the hero similarly receives from his mother
a ring, which was to be a token of recognition to his illegitimate brother.
So, in the romance, Horn makes himself known in the sequel to Rigmel,
by dropping the ring she had given him into the drinking-horn which she
was serving round at a feast. Rings were often given to messengers as
credentials, or were used for the same purpose as letters of introduction.
In the romance of ‚ÄúFloire and Blanceflor‚Äù (p. 55), the young hero, on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
his way to Babylon, arrives at a bridge, the keeper of which has a brother
in the great city, to whose hospitality he wishes to recommend Floire,
and for that purpose he gives him his ring. ‚ÄúTake this ring to him,‚Äù he
says, ‚Äúand tell him from me to receive you in his best manner.‚Äù The
message was attended with complete success. In our cut <a href="#n193">No. 193</a>, taken
from a manuscript of the fourteenth century in the British Museum
(MS. Reg. 10 E. iv.), the messenger arrives with the letter of which
he is the bearer, and at the same time exhibits a ring in the place of
credentials.</p>

<p>There was another circumstance which gave value and importance to
rings in the middle ages. Not only might rings be charmed by the
power of the magician, but it was an article of general belief that the
engraved stones of the ancients, which were found commonly enough on
old sites, and even the precious stones in general, without any engraving,
possessed extraordinary virtues, the benefit of which was imparted to those
who carried them on their persons. In the romance of ‚ÄúMelusine‚Äù
(p. 357), the heroine, when about to leave the house of her husband,
gives him two rings, and says, ‚ÄúMy sweet love, you see here two rings of
gold, which have both the same virtue; and know well for truth, that so
long as you possess them, or one of them, you shall never be overcome
in pleading nor in battle, if your cause be rightful: and neither you nor
others who may possess them, shall ever die by any weapons.‚Äù In a story
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
among the collection of the ‚ÄúGesta Romanorum,‚Äù edited by sir Frederic
Madden for the Roxburghe Club (p. 150), a father is made, on his deathbed,
to give to his son a ring, ‚Äúthe virtue of which was, that whosoever
should bear it upon him, should have the love of all men.‚Äù The ring
given by the princess Rigmel to Horn possessed virtues of an equally
remarkable description&mdash;‚ÄúWhoever bore it upon him could not perish;
he need not fear to die either in fire or water, or in field of battle, or in
the contention of the tournament.‚Äù So, in the romance of ‚ÄúFloire and
Blanceflor‚Äù (p. 42), the queen gives her son a ring which would protect
him against all danger, and assure to him the eventual attainment of every
object of his wishes. Nor was the ring of sir Perceval of Galles (Thornton
Romances, p. 71) at all less remarkable in its properties, of which the
rhymer says&mdash;</p>

<p>The consideration of the house and its parts and furniture, and of the
outward forms of domestic life, leads us naturally to that of the constitution
of the family. It was the chief pride of the aristocratic class to live
very extravagantly, and to support a great household, with an immense
number of personal attendants of different classes. In the first place the
old system of fostering, which was kept up to a comparatively late period,
added to the number of the lord‚Äôs or knight‚Äôs family. As might was
literally right in the middle ages, each man of worth sought to strengthen
himself by the alliances which were formed by finding powerful foster-fathers
for his sons, and the personal attachment and fidelity between the
chief of the family and his foster-child was often greater even than that
between the father and his own son. In addition to the foster children,
gentlemen sent their sons to take an honourable kind of service in the
families of men of higher rank or greater wealth, where the manners and
accomplishments of gentlemen were to be learnt in greater perfection
than at home; and the younger sons of great families sought similar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
service with a view to their advancement in the world. These two
classes were the young squires, who served at table, and performed a great
number of what we should now call menial offices to the lord and ladies
of the household, in all the amusements and recreations of which they
took part, and at the same time were instructed in gentlemanly manners
and exercises&mdash;it was a sort of apprenticeship introductory to knighthood.
In the same manner the knightly families sent their daughters to serve
under the ladies of the greater or lesser feudal chieftains, and they formed
that class who, in the French romances and fabliaux, are called the
<i>chambri√®res</i>, or chamber attendants, and in the English texts, simply the
<i>maidens</i>, of the establishment. The ladies of rank prided themselves
upon having a very great number of these <i>chambri√®res</i>, or maidens, for
they were not only a means of ostentation, but they were profitable,
inasmuch as besides attending on the personal wants of their mistresses,
they were constantly employed in spinning, weaving, and the various
processes of producing cloth, in millinery and dress-making, in embroidery,
and in a great number of similar labours, which were not only required
for furnishing the large number of persons who depended upon their
lord for their liveries, &amp;c., but which were sometimes sold to obtain
money, which was always a scarce thing in the country. The beauty of
the <i>pucelles</i>, as they are often termed in the French text, or maidens,
is also spoken of as a subject of pride. In a metrical story printed
by Meon (ii. 38), a great lady receiving a female stranger into her
household, became so much attached to her, ‚Äúthat she made more of
her than of all her maidens, of whom,‚Äù it is added, ‚Äúthere were handsome
ones in her chambers‚Äù&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>De li la dame fet grant feste,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Plus que de totes ses puceles,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dont en ses chambres a de beles.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

And so, in the romance of ‚ÄúBlonde of Oxford‚Äù (p. 30), when the
countess went with her maidens to visit John, the remark is made that
among them there were plenty of beauties:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Et la contesse et ses puceles,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dont ele avoit ass√©s de beles.</i><br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
</div></div>

<p>The usual age for sending a boy to foster appears to have been seven
years. That was the age at which Fulke Fitz-Warine was sent to
Joce de Dynan in Ludlow Castle. ‚ÄúThe lady,‚Äù the narrative tells us,
‚Äúbecame with child; when she was delivered, at the time ordained by
God, they called the child Fulke. And when the child was seven years
old, they sent it to Joce de Dynan to teach and nourish; for Joce was a
knight of good accomplishment. Joce received him with great honour
and great affection, and educated him in his chambers with his own
children.‚Äù Fulke the younger, in the next generation, was taken as his
foster-child by the king (Henry II.), and was nourished and educated
with the young princes, of whom John, in the sequel, proved a bad foster-brother.
The great barons sought to form alliances of this kind with the
king, as well as with his great ministers and other men of power. In
the romance of ‚ÄúGarin le Loherain‚Äù (vol. i. p. 62), king Pepin gives the
two orphan sons of Hervis of Metz, Garin and Begon, as foster-children
to the count Hardr√©s, and they thus become severally the foster-brothers,
or, as they are termed in the old French, <i>compains</i> (companions), of his
two sons, Begon being the foster-brother of Guillaume of Montclin, and
Garin of Fromont. Although they belong to rival families, and are each
other‚Äôs enemies through the turbulent scenes which form the subject of
the story, the sentiment of the relationship by fostering often shows itself.
This yearning after something beyond mere ordinary friendship seems to
have been often felt in the middle ages, and led to various characteristic
practices, among which one of the most remarkable was that of sworn
brotherhood. Two men&mdash;they are generally knights&mdash;who felt a sufficiently
strong sentiment towards each other, engaged, under the most
solemn oaths, in a bond of fraternity for life, implying a constant and
faithful friendship to each other. This practice enters largely into the
plot of several of the medi√¶val romances, as in that of ‚ÄúAmis and
Amiloun,‚Äù and in the curious English metrical romance of ‚ÄúKing
Athelston,‚Äù printed in the ‚ÄúReliqui√¶ Antiqu√¶.‚Äù The desire for this true
friendship was not unnaturally increased by the general prevalence of
treacherous falsehood and hateful feuds. There is a beautiful passage in
the romance of ‚ÄúGarin,‚Äù just quoted, which illustrates this sentiment,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
while it furnishes an interesting picture of domestic life. ‚ÄúOne day,‚Äù we
are told, ‚ÄúBegues was in his castle of Belin, and beside him sat the
beautiful Beatris. The duke kissed her both on the mouth and on the
cheeks, and very sweetly the duchess smiled. In the middle of the hall
she saw her two sons, the eldest of whom was Garin, and the youngest
was named Hernaudin; their ages were respectively twelve years, and ten.
Along with them were six <i>damoisels</i> (gentlemen‚Äôs sons) of worth, and
they were running and leaping together, and playing, and laughing, and
making game. The duke looked at them, and began to sigh; which
was observed by the lady, who questioned him&mdash;‚ÄòAh! rich duke! why
have you sorrowful thoughts? You have gold and silver in your coffers,
falcons in plenty on your perches, and rich cloths, buildings, and mules,
and palfreys, and baggage-horses; and you have crushed all your enemies.
You have no neighbour within six days‚Äô journey powerful enough to
refuse to come to your service if you send for him.‚Äô ‚ÄòLady,‚Äô said the
duke, ‚Äòwhat you say is true; but in one thing you have made a great
oversight. Wealth consists neither in rich cloths, nor in money, nor in
buildings, nor in horses but it is made of kinsmen and friends: the heart
of one man is worth all the gold in a country.‚Äô‚Äù&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>The incident of the younger, or even at times the elder, sons of feudal
lords or landholders going to seek service is the groundwork of the
romance of ‚ÄúBlonde of Oxford,‚Äù and of the story of ‚ÄúCourtois d‚ÄôArras,‚Äù
printed by Meon in his collection of fabliaux and stories. The latter tale
is a medi√¶val version of the scriptural story of the Prodigal Son. Youths
of good family easily found service in this manner, and the service itself
was not considered dishonourable, because lords and gentlemen admitted
nobody to immediate attendance on their persons but sons of gentlemen&mdash;persons
of as good blood as themselves. To be a good servant was a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
gentlemanly accomplishment, and the payment these gentlemanly servants
received consisted ordinarily in their clothing and gifts of various kinds,
rarely in money. I have already hinted that the intercourse between
the male and female portions of the household was on a footing of
familiarity and freedom, and at the same time on a tone of gallantry
which could hardly produce a high degree of morality, but the details on
this subject, though very abundant, are in great part of a description
which cannot here be entered upon. This intercourse extended to what
we should now call the privacy of the bed-chamber. It was usual,
indeed, for the ladies to receive visits from the gentlemen, <i>t√™te-√†-t√™te</i>,
in their chamber. In the fabliau of ‚ÄúGuillaume au Faucon,‚Äù printed in
Barbazan, the young ‚Äúdamoisel,‚Äù as the noble youth was usually termed,
having fallen in love with the beautiful wife of the lord in whose service
he was, took an opportunity of visiting her in her chamber, when he
knew that all her maidens were employed in another part of the building.
Without knocking, he opened the door gently, and found the lady sitting
alone on her bed. The lady saluted him with ‚Äúa sweet smile,‚Äù and told
him to come in and sit on the bed by her side, and there ‚Äúhe laughed,
and talked, and plaid with her, and the lady did the same‚Äù&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Rit et parole et joe √† li,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Et la dame tot autresi.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

In the midst of these familiarities, Guillaume made his declaration of
love, and was rejected, but his pursuit was ultimately successful. In
another fabliau of the thirteenth century, that of ‚ÄúGautier d‚ÄôAupais,‚Äù it
is the daughter of his lord and lady with whom the young ‚Äúdamoisel‚Äù
falls in love, and he takes the opportunity one morning, while the two
latter are at church, to pay a visit to the young lady in her chamber.
Although in bed on account of illness&mdash;and it has been already stated
how people went to bed without any clothing&mdash;the lady is not surprised
by Gautier‚Äôs visit, but invites him to sit on her bed, and tell her something
to amuse her, and he finds the opportunity of making his love with more
success than the hero of the other tale. In the same manner, the ladies
are continually described as visiting the gentlemen in their chambers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
both by day and by night. In ‚ÄúBlonde of Oxford,‚Äù a fashionable
romance composed for the entertainment of the best society, Blonde thus
leaves her bed, throwing only a mantle over her person, to pass whole
nights with Jean of Dammartin, and their interviews are described in
language which would not be allowed in any respectable book at the
present day. The chevalier de la Tour-Landry, in his moral instructions
to his daughters, tells them a story to illustrate the ill results of a quarrelsome
temper. There was a young lady, he says, the daughter of ‚Äúa
very gentle knight,‚Äù who quarrelled at the game of tables with a gentleman
who had no better temper than herself, and who, provoked by the
irritating language she used towards him, told her that she was known
to be in the habit of going by night into the men‚Äôs chambers, and
kissing and embracing them in their beds without candle; and this is
told, not in reproof of conduct which was unusually bad, but to show
that people who speak ill of others run the risk of having their own
failings exposed. Examples of this intercourse of persons of different
sexes in their chambers, and of the results which frequently followed,
from the medi√¶val romances and stories, might be multiplied to almost
any extent.</p>

<p>In these stories, the ladies in general show no great degree of delicacy,
but, on the contrary, they are commonly very forward. It is usual with
them to fall in love with the other sex, and, so far from attempting to
conceal their passion, they often become suitors, and make their advances
with more warmth and less delicacy than is shown by the gentlemen in a
similar position. Not only are their manners dissolute, but their language
and conversation are loose beyond anything that those who have not read
these interesting records of medi√¶val life can easily conceive, which was a
common failing with both sexes. The author of the ‚ÄúM√©nagier de Paris‚Äù
(ii. 60), in recommending to his daughters some degree of modesty on
this point, makes use of words which his modern editor, although printing
a text in obsolete language, thought it advisable to suppress. It might be
argued that the use of such language is evidence rather of the coarseness
than of the immorality of the age, but, unfortunately, the latter interpretation
is supported by the whole tenor of contemporary literature and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
anecdote, which leave no doubt that medi√¶val society was profoundly
immoral and licentious.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the gallantry and refinement of feeling which the
gentleman is made to show towards the other sex, is but a conventional
politeness; for the ladies are too often treated with great brutality. Men
beating their wives, and even women with whom they quarrel who are
not their wives, is a common incident in the tales and romances. The
chevalier de la Tour-Landry tells his daughters the story of a woman who
was in the habit of contradicting her husband in public, and replying to
him ungraciously, for which, after the husband had expostulated in vain,
he one day raised his fist and knocked her down, and kicked her in the
face while she was down, and broke her nose. ‚ÄúAnd so,‚Äù says the
knightly instructor, ‚Äúshe was disfigured for life, and thus, through her
ill behaviour and bad temper, she had her nose spoiled, which was a great
misfortune to her. It would have been better for her to be silent and
submissive, for it is only right that words of authority should belong to
her lord, and the wife‚Äôs honour requires that she should listen in peace
and obedience.‚Äù The good ‚Äúchevalier‚Äù makes no remark on the
husband‚Äôs brutality, as though it were by no means an unusual occurrence.</p>

<p>A trouv√®re of the thirteenth century, named Robert de Blois, compiled
a code of instructions in good manners for young ladies in French
verse, under the title of the ‚ÄúChastisement des Dames,‚Äù which is printed
by Barbazan, and forms a curious illustration of feudal domestic manners.
It was unbecoming in a lady, according to Robert de Blois, to talk too
much; she ought especially to refrain from boasting of the attentions paid
to her by the other sex; and she was recommended not to show too much
freedom in her games and amusements, lest the men should be encouraged
to libertinism. In going to church, she was not to ‚Äútrot or run,‚Äù
but to walk seriously, not going in advance of her company, and looking
straight before her, and not to this side or the other, but to salute
‚Äúdebonairely‚Äù all persons she met. She is recommended not to let men
put their hands into her breasts, or kiss her on the mouth, as it might lead
to greater familiarities. She was not to look at a man too much, unless
he were her acknowledged lover; and when she had a lover, she was not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
to boast or talk too much of him. She was not to expose her body
uncovered out of vanity, as her breast, or her legs, or her sides, nor to
undress in the presence of men. She was not to be too ready in accepting
presents from the other sex. The ladies are particularly warned against
scolding and disputing, against swearing, against eating and drinking too
freely at table, and against getting drunk, the latter being a practice from
which much mischief might arise. A lady was not to cover her face
when the went in public, as a handsome face was made to be seen, and it
was not good manners to remain with the face covered before a gentleman
of rank. An exception, however, is made in the case of ugly or deformed
faces, which might be covered. There was another exception to the
counsel just mentioned. ‚ÄúA lady who is pale-faced, or who has not a
good smell, ought to breakfast early in the morning; for good wine gives
a very good colour; and she who eats and drinks well must heighten
her colour.‚Äù One who has bad breath is recommended to eat aniseed,
fennel, and cumin to her breakfast, and to avoid breathing in people‚Äôs
faces. A lady is to be very attentive to her behaviour in church, rules for
which are given. If she could sing, she was to do so when asked, and
not require too much pressing. Ladies are further recommended to keep
their hands clean, to cut their nails often, and not to suffer them to grow
beyond the finger, or to harbour dirt. In passing other people‚Äôs houses,
ladies were not to look into them; ‚Äúfor a person often does things
privately in his house, which he would not wish to be seen, if any one
should come before his door.‚Äù For this reason, too, when a lady went
into another person‚Äôs house, she is recommended to cough at the entrance,
or to speak out loud, so that the inmates might not be taken by surprise.
The directions for a lady‚Äôs behaviour at table are very particular. ‚ÄúIn
eating, you must avoid much laughing or talking. If you eat with
another (<i>i. e.</i>, in the same plate, or of the same mess), turn the nicest bits
to him, and do not go picking out the finest and largest for yourself,
which is not courteous. Moreover, no one should eat greedily a choice
bit which is too large or too hot, for fear of choking or burning herself....
Each time you drink, wipe your mouth well, that no grease may
go into the wine, which is very unpleasant to the person who drinks after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
you. But when you wipe your mouth for drinking, do not wipe your
eyes or nose with the table-cloth, and avoid spilling from your mouth,
or greasing your hands too much.‚Äù The lady is further, and particularly,
recommended not to utter falsehoods. The remainder of the poem
consist of directions in making love and receiving the addresses of suitors.
The ‚ÄúBook‚Äù of the chevalier de la Tour-Landry contains instructions for
young ladies, in substance very much like these, but illustrated by stories
and examples.</p>

<p>The chamber-maidens also went abroad, like the young sons of
gentlemen; but female servants who came as strangers appear not in
general to have been well regarded, and they probably were, or were
considered as, a lower class. The circumstance of their having left the
country where they were known, was looked upon as <i>prima facie</i> evidence
that their conduct had brought them into discredit there. The author of
the ‚ÄúM√©nagier de Paris‚Äù advises his daughter never to take any such
<i>chambri√®res</i>, without having first sent to make strict inquiries about them
in the parts from whence they came. This same early writer on domestic
economy divides the servants, who, in a large household, were very
numerous, into three classes: those who were employed on a sudden, and
only for a certain work, with regard to whom the principal caution given
is to bargain with them for the price of their labour before they begin;
those who were employed for a certain time in a particular description of
work, as tailors, shoemakers, butchers, and others, who always came to
work in the house on materials belonging to the master of the house,
or harvest-men, &amp;c., in the country; and domestic servants who were
hired by the year. These latter were expected to pay an absolute passive
obedience to the lord and lady of the household, and to those set in
authority by them. The lady of the house had the especial charge of the
female servants, and the ‚ÄúM√©nagier‚Äù contains rather minute directions
as to her housekeeping duties. She was to require of the maid-servants,
‚Äúthat early in the morning the entrance to your hostel, that is, the hall,
and the other places by which people enter and stop in the hostel to
converse, be swept and made clean, and that the footstools and covers of
the benches and forms be dusted and shaken, and after this that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
other chambers be in like manner cleaned and arranged for the day.‚Äù
They were next to attend to and feed all the ‚Äúchamber animals,‚Äù such
as pet dogs, cage birds, &amp;c. The next thing to be done was to portion
out to each servant her or his work for the day. At midday the servants
were to have their first meal, when they were to be fed plentifully, but
‚Äúonly of one meat, and not of several or of any delicacies; and give
them one only kind of drink, nourishing but not heady, whether wine or
other; and admonish them to eat heartily, and to drink well and plentifully,
for it is right that they should eat all at once, without sitting too
long, and at one breath, without reposing on their meal, or halting, or
leaning with their elbows on the table; and as soon as they begin to talk,
or to rest on their elbows, make them rise, and remove the table.‚Äù After
their ‚Äúsecond labour,‚Äù and on feast-days, the servants were to have
another, apparently a lighter, repast, and lastly, in the evening (<i>au vespre</i>),
they were to have another abundant meal, like their dinner, and then,
‚Äúif the season required it,‚Äù they were to be ‚Äúwarmed and made comfortable.‚Äù
The lady of the house was then, by herself or a deputy on
whom she could depend, to see that the house was closed, and to take
charge of the keys, that nobody could go out or come in; and then to
have all the fires carefully ‚Äúcovered,‚Äù and send all the servants to bed,
taking care that they put out their candles properly, to prevent the risk
of fire. In the English poem of the ‚ÄúSeven Sages,‚Äù printed by Weber,
the emperor is described as going to his chamber, after the time of
locking windows and gates&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>Themparour com to chambre late.</i><br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Weber, iii. 60.<br /></span>
</span></span>

And it appears from a tale in the same collection, that the doors and
windows were unlocked at daybreak&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Tho</i> (when) <i>the day dawen gan,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Men unlek dore and windowe</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Ib., p. 87.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was another duty performed by the ladies in the medi√¶val
household, which was a very important one in an age of turbulence, and
must not be overlooked&mdash;they were both nurses and doctors. Medical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
men were not then at hand to be consulted, and the sick or wounded
man was handed over to the care of the mistress of the house and her
maidens. The reader of Chaucer will remember the medicinal knowledge
displayed by dame Pertelot in the ‚ÄúNonne-Prestes Tale.‚Äù Medicinal
herbs were grown in every garden, and were dried or made into
decoctions, and kept for use. In the early romances we often meet with
ladies who possessed plants and other objects which possessed the power
of miraculous cures, and which they had obtained in some mysterious
manner. Thus, in the Carlovingian romance of ‚ÄúGaufrey,‚Äù when
Robastre was so dangerously wounded that there remained no hope of his
life, the good wife of the traitor Grifon undertook to cure him. ‚ÄúAnd
she went to a coffer and opened it, and took out of it a herb which has
so great virtue that whoever takes it will be relieved from all harm. She
pounded and mixed it in a mortar, and then came to Robastre and gave
it him. It had no sooner passed his throat than he was as sound as an
apple‚Äù (‚ÄúGaufrey,‚Äù p. 119). So in ‚ÄúFierabras‚Äù (p. 67), the Saracen
princess Floripas had in her chamber the powerful ‚Äúmandeglore‚Äù (mandrake),
which she applied to the wounds of Oliver, and they were
instantly healed. In the ‚ÄúRoman de la Violette‚Äù (p. 104), when
Gerart, desperately wounded, is carried into the castle, the maiden
who was lady of it took him into a chamber, and there took off his
armour, undressed him, and put him to bed. They examined all his
wounds, and applied to them ointments of great efficacy, and under this
treatment he soon recovered. In the English romance of ‚ÄúAmis and
Amiloun,‚Äù when sir Amiloun is discovered struck with leprosy, the wife
of his friend Amis takes him into her chamber, strips him of all his
clothing, bathes him herself, and then puts him to bed&mdash;

To the knowledge of medicines was too often added another knowledge,
that of poisons&mdash;a science which was carried to a great degree of perfection
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
in the middle ages, and of which there were regular professors.
The practice of poisoning was, indeed, carried on to a frightful extent,
and it appears, from a variety of evidence, that women were commonly
agents in it.</p>

<p>A great part of the foregoing remarks apply exclusively to the aristocratic
portion of society, which included all those who had the right to
become knights. Through the whole extent of this portion of society
one blood was believed to run, which was distinguished from that of all
other classes by the title of ‚Äúgentle blood.‚Äù The pride of gentle blood,
which was one of the distinguishing characteristics of feudalism, was very
great in the middle ages. It was believed that the mark of this blood
could never disappear; and many of the medi√¶val stories turn upon the
circumstance of a child of gentle blood having been stolen or abandoned
in its earlier infancy, and bred up, without any knowledge of its origin,
as a peasant among peasants, or as a burgher among burghers, but displaying,
as it grew towards manhood, by its conduct, the unmistakable
proofs of its gentle origin, in spite of education and example. The
burgher class&mdash;the merchant or tradesman, or the manufacturer&mdash;appear
always as money-getting and money-saving people, and individuals often
became very rich. This circumstance became a temptation, on the one
hand, to the aristocrat, whose tendency was usually, through his prodigality,
to become poor, and, on the other, to the rich man of no blood, who
sought to buy aristocratic alliances by his wealth, and intermarriages
between the two classes were not very unfrequent. In most cases, at least
in the romances and stories, it was an aristocratic young lady who became
united with a wealthy merchant, and it was usually a stroke of selfish
policy on the part of the lady‚Äôs father. In the fabliau of the ‚ÄúVilain
Mire‚Äù (Barbazan, ii. 1)&mdash;the origin of Moli√®re‚Äôs ‚ÄúM√©decin malgr√© lui,‚Äù&mdash;and
in one or two other old stories, the aristocratic young lady is married
to an agriculturist. Marriages of this description are represented as being
never happy; the husband has no sympathy for his wife‚Äôs gentility, and,
according to the code of ‚Äúchivalry,‚Äù the lady was perfectly justified
in being unfaithful to her husband as often as the liked, especially if she
sinned with men who were superior to him in blood.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<p>It was common for the burgher class to ape gentility, even among
people of a lower order; for the great merchant was often superior in
education and in intelligence, as he was in wealth, to the great majority
of the aristocratic class. In Chaucer, even the wife of the miller aspired
to the aristocratic title of madame&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ther durste no wight clepe</i> (call) <i>hir but madame</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Cant. Tales, l. 3954.<br /></span>
</span></span>

And in speaking of the wives of various burghers who joined in the
pilgrimage, the poet remarks&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>It is right fair for to be clept</i> (called) <i>madame</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Ibid., l. 378.<br /></span>
</span></span>

The burghers also cherished a number of servants and followers in their
household, or <i>mesnie</i>. In the fabliau of ‚ÄúLa Borgoise d‚ÄôOrliens,‚Äù the
mesnie of the burgher, who is not represented as a person of wealth or
distinction, consists of two nephews, a lad who carried water, three
chamber-maidens, a niece, two pautoniers, and a ribald, and these were
all harboured in the hall. The pautonier was only another name for the
ribald, or perhaps it was a sub-class or division of the infamous class who
lived parasitically upon the society of the middle ages. Even the ordinary
agriculturist had his <i>mesnie</i>.</p>

<p>What I have said of the great dissoluteness and immorality of the
aristocratic class applies more especially to the households of the greater
barons, though the same spirit must have spread itself far through the
whole class. The aristocratic class was itself divided into two classes, or
rather two ranks,&mdash;the great barons, and the knights and lesser landholders,
and the division between these two classes became wider, and the latter
more absolutely independent, as the power of feudalism declined. These
latter were the origin of that class which in more modern times has been
known by the title of the old country gentleman. As far as we can
judge from what we know of them, I am led to think that this class
was the most truly dignified, and in general the most moral, portion of
medi√¶val society. There is abundant evidence that the tone of morality
in the burgher and agricultural classes was not high; and the whole
tenor of medi√¶val popular and historical literature can leave no doubt on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
our minds that in the middle ages the clergy were the great corruptors
of domestic virtue among both these classes. The character of the
women, as described in the old satirists and story-tellers, as well as in
records of a still more strictly truthful character, was very low, and, in
the towns especially, they are described as spending much of their time
in the taverns, drinking and gossiping. Of course there were everywhere&mdash;and,
it is to be trusted, not a few&mdash;bright exceptions to this general
character.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Humboldt</span>, in his ‚ÄúCosmos,‚Äù has dwelt on the taste for the
beauties of nature which has prevailed among various peoples, and
at different periods of the world‚Äôs history, but he appears to me to have
by no means appreciated or done justice to the force of this sentiment
among our forefathers in the middle ages, and, perhaps I may say,
especially in England. In our ancient popular poetry, the mention of
the season of the year at which an event happens generally draws from
the poet some allusion to the charms of nature peculiar to it, to the
sweetness of the flowers, the richness of the fruit, or the harmony of the
song of birds. In some of the early romances, each new division of
the poem is introduced by an allusion of this kind. Thus, at the
opening of what the editor calls the first chapter of the second part of
the romance of ‚ÄúRichard C≈ìur de Lion,‚Äù the poet tells us how it&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Merye is in the tyme of May,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Whenne foulis synge in her lay;</i><br /></span>

</span></span>

Such interruptions of the narrative are frequent in the long romance of
‚ÄúAlexander‚Äù (Alexander the Great), and are always expressive. Thus,
on one occasion the poet tells us, abruptly enough, how&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

<p>When, indeed, we consider the confined and dark character of most
of the apartments of the feudal dwelling, we cannot be surprised if our
medi√¶val forefathers loved the recreations which brought them into the
open air. Castles and country mansions had always their gardens and
pleasure-grounds, which were much frequented by all the different
branches of the household. The readers of Chaucer will remember the
description of the ‚Äúnoble‚Äù knight January&mdash;

These lines show us that our forefathers in the middle ages had their
dancing girls, just as they had and still have them in the East; it was one
trait of the mixture of Oriental manners with those of Europe which had
taken place since the crusades.</p>

<p>In these extracts, indeed, we have allusions to the practices of dancing
and singing, of playing at chess and tables, of drinking, and even of
dining, in the gardens. Our engraving <a href="#n194">No. 194</a>, taken from the romance
of ‚ÄúAlexander,‚Äù in the Bodleian Library, represents a garden scene, in
which two royal personages are playing at chess. Dancing in the open
air was a very common recreation, and is not unfrequently alluded to.
In the Roman de Geste, known by the title of ‚ÄúLa Mort de Garin,‚Äù
a large dinner party is given in a garden&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

And, in the ‚ÄúRoman de Berte‚Äù (p. 4), Charles Martel is represented as
dining similarly in the garden, at the midsummer season, when the rose
was in blossom&mdash;</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 194. A. Medi√¶val Garden Scene.</i></p></div>

<p>There is an early Latin story of a man who had a cross-grained wife.
One day he invited some friends to dinner, and set out his table in his
garden, by the side of a river (<i>fecit poni mensam in hortu suo prope aquam</i>).
The lady seated herself by the water-side, at a little distance from the
table, and cast a very forbidding look upon her husband‚Äôs guests; upon
which he said to her, ‚ÄúShow a pleasant countenance to our guests, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
come nearer the table;‚Äù but she only moved further off, and nearer the
brink of the river, with her back turned to the water. He repeated his
invitation in a more angry tone, in reply to which, to show her ill-humour,
she drew further back, with a quick movement of ill-temper, through
which, forgetting the nearness of the river, she fell into it, and was
drowned. The husband, pretending great grief, sent for a boat, and
proceeded up the stream in search of her body. This excited some
surprise among his neighbours, who suggested to him that he should go
down the stream, and not up. ‚ÄúAh!‚Äù said he, ‚Äúyou did not know my
wife&mdash;she did everything in contradiction, and I firmly believe that her
body has floated against the current, and not with it.‚Äù</p>

<p>Even among the aristocratic class the garden was often the place for
giving audience and receiving friends. In the romance of ‚ÄúGarin le
Loherain,‚Äù a messenger sent to the count Fromont, one of the great
barons, finds him sitting in a garden surrounded by his friends&mdash;</p>

<p>A favourite occupation of the ladies in the middle ages was making
garlands and chaplets of flowers. In the ‚ÄúLai d‚ÄôAristote‚Äù (Barbazan, iii.
105, 107), king Alexander‚Äôs beautiful mistress is described as descending
early in the morning, walking in the garden alone, and making herself a
chaplet of flowers. In another fabliau, published in Germany by Adelbert
Keller, a Saracenic maiden descends from her chamber into the garden,
performs her toilette at the fountain there, and then makes herself a
chaplet of flowers and leaves, which she puts on her head. So Emelie,
in Chaucer‚Äôs ‚ÄúKnights Tale,‚Äù&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

A little further on, Arcyte goes at daybreak into the fields to make him a

that this takes place in the month of May, which was especially
the season for wearing garlands. In ‚ÄúBlonde of Oxford,‚Äù Jean of

a chaplet of flowers&mdash;

Our cut <a href="#n195">No. 195</a>, taken from a well-known manuscript in the British
Museum, of the beginning of the fourteenth century (MS. Reg. 2 B. vii.),
represents a party of ladies in the garden, gathering flowers, and making
garlands. The love of flowers, as I have stated in a former chapter, seems
to have prevailed generally among our Anglo-Saxon forefathers, and
affectionate allusions to them occur, not unfrequently, in the literary
remains of that early period. Many of our old favourite garden-flowers
are, I believe, derived from the Anglo-Saxon gardens. Proofs of a similar
attachment to flowers might be quoted in abundance from the writings
of the periods subsequent to the entrance of the Normans. The wearing
of garlands or chaplets of flowers was a common practice with both sexes.
In the romantic history of the Fitz-Warines, written in the thirteenth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
century, the hero, in travelling, meets a young knight who, in token of
his joyous humour, carries a chaplet of flowers on his head. In the later
English romance of the ‚ÄúSquyer of Lowe Degree,‚Äù when the ‚Äúsquyer‚Äù
was preparing to do his office of carver in the hall&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

Garlands of flowers were also the common rewards for success in the
popular games.</p>

<p>All these enjoyments naturally rendered the garden a favourite and
important part of every man‚Äôs domestic establishment; during the warmer
months of the year it was a chosen place of resort, especially after dinner.
In the romance of ‚ÄúGarin le Loherain,‚Äù Begues is represented as
descending from his palace, after dinner, to walk with his fair wife
Beatrice in his garden&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

In another part of the same romance, Begues de Belin and his barons, on
rising from the table, went to seek recreation in the fields&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

The manuscript in the British Museum, from which we took our last
illustration, furnishes the accompanying representation of a group of ladies
walking in the garden, and gathering flowers (<a href="#n196">No. 196</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n196" src="images/i_n196.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 196. Ladies walking in the Garden.</i></p></div>

<p>In the ‚ÄúM√©nagier de Paris,‚Äù compiled about the year 1393, its author,
addressing his young wife, treats briefly of the behaviour of a woman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
when she is walking out, and especially when passing along the streets of
a town, or going to church. ‚ÄúAs you go,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúlook straight before
you, with your eye-lids low and fixed, looking forward to the ground, at
five toises (thirty feet) before you, and not looking at, or turning your
eyes, to man or woman who may be to your right or left, nor looking
upwards, nor changing your look from one place to another, nor laughing,
nor stopping to speak to anybody in the street‚Äù (vol. i. p. 15). It must
be confessed that this is, in some points, rather hard counsel for a lady to
follow; but it is consistent with the general system of formalities of
behaviour in the middle ages, upon which the ladies gladly took their
revenge when removed from constraint. When two or more persons
walked together, it was the custom to hold each other by the hands, not
to walk arm-in-arm, which appears to be a very modern practice. In the
romance of ‚ÄúOgier le Danois,‚Äù the emperor and Ogier, when reconciled,
are thus represented, walking in a friendly manner hand in hand. The
ladies in our last engraving are walking in this manner; and in our next
(<a href="#n197">No. 197</a>),&mdash;taken from a copy, given in M. du Sommerard‚Äôs ‚ÄúAlbum,‚Äù
from a manuscript in the library of the arsenal at Paris, written and
illuminated for a prince of the house of Burgundy, in the fifteenth
century,&mdash;the lords and ladies of a noble or princely household are represented
as walking out in the same manner. It is well known that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
court of Burgundy, in the fifteenth century, offered the model of strict
etiquette. This illustration gives us also a very good picture of a street
scene of the period to which it belongs. The height of gentility, however,
at least, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, seems to have been
to hold the lady by the finger only. It is in this manner that, in the
romance of ‚ÄúOgier le Danois,‚Äù the hero holds the princess Gloriande&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

So, in the romance of ‚ÄúLa Violette,‚Äù at the festivities given by the king,
the guests ‚Äúdistributed themselves in couples in the hall (<i>i. e.</i> a gentleman
with a lady), <i>one taking the other by the finger</i>, and so they arranged
themselves two and two‚Äù&mdash;</p>

As a mark of great familiarity, two princes, Pepin‚Äôs son, Charles, and the

mantle, as they walked along; they were
going to church together:&mdash;</p>

<p>It may be remarked that sitting was
equally a matter of etiquette with walking,
though we sometimes meet with
ladies and gentlemen seated in a manner
which is anything but ceremonious. In
the annexed cut (<a href="#n198">No. 198</a>), taken from
a manuscript of the fourteenth century,
the reference to which I have unfortunately
lost, a number of ladies, seated
on the ground, and apparently in the open air, are listening to the admonitions
of an episcopal preacher.</p>

<p>As I have introduced the subject of the love of our forefathers for
trees and flowers, some account of gardening in the middle ages will not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
be out of place, especially as what has hitherto been written on the history
of gardening in England during this early period, has been very imperfect
and incorrect. We have no direct information relating to the gardens of
our Anglo-Saxon forefathers&mdash;in fact, our knowledge is limited to a few
words gathered from the old vocabularies. The ordinary names for a
garden, <i>wyrt-tun</i> and <i>wyrt-geard</i>, a plant-inclosure and a plant-yard, are
entirely indefinite, for the word <i>wyrt</i> was applied to all plants whatever,
and perhaps they indicate what we should call the kitchen-garden. The
latter word, which was sometimes spelt <i>ort-geard</i>, <i>orc-geard</i>, and <i>orcyrd</i>,
was the origin of our modern <i>orchard</i>, which is now limited to an inclosure
of fruit-trees. Flowers were probably cultivated in the inclosed space
round the houses. It would appear that the Saxons, before they became
acquainted with the Romans, cultivated very few plants, if we may judge
from the circumstance that throughout the Anglo-Saxon period the names
by which these were known were nearly all derived from the Latin.
The leek appears to have been the principal table vegetable among the
Anglo-Saxons, as it was among the Welsh its name, <i>leac</i>, or <i>leah</i>, is
pure Anglo-Saxon, and its importance was considered so much above
that of any other vegetable, that <i>leac-tun</i>, the leek-garden, became the
common name for the kitchen-garden, and <i>leac-weard</i>, a leek-keeper,
was used to designate the gardener. The other alliaceous plants were
considered as so many varieties of the leek, and were known by such
names as <i>enne-leac</i>, or <i>ynne-leac</i>, supposed to be the onion, and <i>gar-leac</i>,
or garlic. <i>Bean</i> is also an Anglo-Saxon word; but, singularly enough,
the Anglo-Saxons seem not to have been originally acquainted with
peas, for the only name they had for them was the Latin <i>pisa</i>, and
<i>pyse</i>. Even for the cabbage tribe, the only Anglo-Saxon name we
know is simply the Latin <i>brassica</i>; and the colewort, which was
named <i>cawl</i>, and <i>cawl-wyrt</i>, was derived from the Latin <i>caulis</i>. So
the turnip was called <i>n√¶pe</i>, from the Latin <i>napus</i>; and <i>r√¶dic</i>, or radish,
is perhaps from <i>raphanus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Garden cresses, parsley, mint, sage, rue,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
and other herbs,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> were in use, but mostly, except the cresses, with
Latin names.</p>

<p>We have long lists of flowering plants in the Anglo-Saxon vocabularies,
but as they are often difficult to identify, and, being chiefly
enumerated for their medicinal qualities, are mostly wild plants, they
throw little light on the character of the flower-garden. For the garden
rose and the lily they used the Roman names <i>rose</i> and <i>lilie</i>; the latter
appears to have been an especially favourite flower among the Anglo-Saxons.
Among other plants, evidently belonging to the garden, are
suthernwood, <i>sutherne-wude</i>, the turnsole or sunflower, called <i>sigel-hwerfe</i>
(the gem-turned) or <i>sols√¶ce</i> (which is merely the Latin <i>solsequium</i>), the
violet (<i>cl√¶fre</i>), the marigold, called <i>read-cl√¶fre</i>, the gilliflower, <i>hwit-cl√¶fre</i>,
the periwinkle, <i>pervinc√¶</i>, the honeysuckle, <i>hunig-sucle</i>, the piony,
for which the Anglo-Saxons had only the Latin word <i>pionia</i>, the daisy,
<i>d√¶ges-eage</i>, and the <i>laur-beam</i>, which was perhaps the bay-tree rather
than the laurel.</p>

<p>The chief fruit of the Anglo-Saxons was undoubtedly the apple, the
name of which, <i>√¶ppel</i>, belongs to their language. The tree was called
an <i>apulder</i>, and the only varieties mentioned are the <i>surmelst apulder</i>, or
souring apple-tree, and the <i>swite apulder</i>, or sweeting apple-tree. The
Anglo-Saxons had orchards containing only apple-trees, to which they
gave the name of an <i>apulder-tun</i>, or apple-tree garden; of the fruit
of which they made what they called, and we still call, cider, and
which they also called <i>√¶ppel-win</i>, or apple-wine. They appear to have
received the pear from the Romans, as its name <i>pera</i>, a pear, and <i>piriga</i>,
a pear-tree, was evidently taken from <i>pirus</i>. They had also derived from
the Roman gardens, no doubt, the cherry-tree (<i>cyrs-treow</i>, or <i>ciris-beam</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
from the Latin <i>cerasus</i>), the peach (<i>persoc-treow</i>, from <i>persicarius</i>), the
mulberry (<i>mor-beam</i>, from <i>morus</i>), the chestnut (<i>cysten</i>, <i>cyst</i>, or <i>cystel-beam</i>,
from <i>castaneus</i>),<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> perhaps the almond (<i>magdala-treow</i>, from <i>amigdalus</i>),
the fig (<i>fic-beam</i>, from <i>ficus</i>), and the pine (<i>pin-treow</i>, from <i>pinus</i>). The
small kernels of the pine were used very extensively in the middle ages,
in the same way as olives. We must add to these the plum (<i>plum-treow</i>),
the name of which is Anglo-Saxon; the medlar, which was known in
Anglo-Saxon by a very unexplainable name, but one which was preferred
to a comparatively recent period; the quince, which was called a <i>cod-√¶ple</i>,
or bag-apple; the nut (<i>hnutu</i>), and the hazel-nut (<i>h√¶sel-hnutu</i>). They
called the olive an oil-tree (<i>ale-beam</i>), which would seem to prove that
they considered its principal utility to be for making oil. The vine was
well-known to the Anglo-Saxons; they called it the <i>win-treow</i>, or wine-tree,
its fruit, <i>winberige</i>, or wine berries, and a bunch of grapes, <i>geclystre</i>,
a cluster. We find no Anglo-Saxon words for gooseberries or currants;
but our forefathers were well acquainted with the strawberry (<i>strea-berige</i>)
and the raspberry, which they called <i>hynd-berige</i>. Perhaps these last-mentioned
fruits, which are known to be natives of Britain, were known
only in their wild state.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>The earliest account of an English garden is given by Alexander
Neckam, who flourished in the latter half of the twelfth century, in the
sixty-sixth chapter of the second book of his treatise, <i>De naturis rerum</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
which exists only in manuscripts (I quote from one in the British Museum,
MS. Reg. 12 G. xi.). He introduces at least one plant, the mandrake,
which was fabulous, and gives several names which I shall be obliged to
leave in his original Latin, as, perhaps through corruption of the text, I
cannot interpret them, but there can be little doubt that it is in general
a correct enumeration of the plants and trees cultivated in a complete
English garden of the period. ‚ÄúA garden,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúshould be adorned
on this part with roses, lilies, the marigold, <i>molis</i>, and mandrakes, and on
that part with parsley, cost, fennel, southernwood, coriander, sage, savery,
hyssop, mint, rue, dittany, smallage, pellitory, lettuce, cresses, <i>ortulano</i>, and
the piony. Let there also be beds (<i>are√¶</i>) enriched with onions, leeks,
garlic, melons, and scallions (<i>hinnuilis</i>). The garden is also ennobled by
the cucumber which creeps on its belly, and by the soporiferous poppy, as
well as by the daffodil and the acanthus. Nor let pot-herbs be wanting, if
you can help it, such as beets, herb mercury, orache, the <i>acedula</i>, (sorrel?)
and the mallow. It is useful also to the gardener to have anise, mustard,
white pepper, and wormwood.‚Äù Neckam then goes on to the fruit-trees.
‚ÄúA noble garden,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúwill give you medlars, quinces, the pearmain
(<i>volema</i>), peaches, pears of St. Regle, pomegranates, citrons (or
lemons), oranges, almonds, dates, and figs.‚Äù When Neckam speaks of
a ‚Äúnoble garden,‚Äù he of course speaks of that of a great baron or prince,
and enumerates fruits of choice, and mostly above the common range.
Medlars and quinces were formerly held in great esteem, and much used.
I have ventured to interpret <i>volema</i> as meaning the pearmain, which was
considered one of the choicest apples, as the apple is not mentioned in the
list, and as in one of the early glossaries that meaning is attached to the
word. Peaches were, as we have seen, known to the Anglo-Saxons;
and in 1276 we find slips of peach-trees mentioned in an official record as
planted in the king‚Äôs garden at Westminster. The pear of St. Regle was
one of the choice kinds of pears brought from France, and it and several
other kinds of pears are enumerated in the accounts of the earl of
Lincoln‚Äôs garden in Holborn (London) in 1296. It is rather surprising
that Mr. Hudson Turner, in his very valuable volume on domestic architecture,
where he supposes that <i>mala aurea</i> in Neckam‚Äôs list were intended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
for the golden apples of the Hesperides, should not have known that the
<i>malum aureum</i> of the middle ages was the orange. Pomegranates, citrons,
oranges, almonds, dates, and figs, are known to have been cultivated in
England at different periods, but it is not probable that the fruit came
often to perfection. It may be remarked that Neckam gives a separate
chapter to the cultivation of the vine, which belonged to the vineyard,
and not to the garden. After an enumeration of plants which were not
grown in Western Europe, Neckam gives a list of others, known for their
medicinal qualities, some of which can hardly have been planted in a
garden, unless it belonged to a physician; although it appears to have
been the custom to devote a corner of the garden to the medicinal plants
most in use, in order that they might be ready at hand when wanted.
The gardener‚Äôs tools in the twelfth century, as enumerated by Neckam
in his treatise <i>De Utensilibus</i>, were few and simple; he had an axe, or
twibill, a knife for grafting, a spade, and a pruning-hook.</p>

<p>John de Garlande lived during the first half of the thirteenth century.
He was an Englishman, but had established himself as a scholar in the
university of Paris, so that the description of his garden which he gives in
his ‚ÄúDictionarius‚Äù may be considered as that of a garden in the neighbourhood
of Paris, which, however, probably hardly differed from a garden
in England. It may be considered as the garden of a respectable burgher.
‚ÄúIn master John‚Äôs garden are these plants, sage, parsley, dittany, hyssop,
celandine, fennel, pellitory, the rose, the lily, and the violet; and at the
side (<i>i. e.</i> in the hedge), the nettle, the thistle, and foxgloves. His
garden also contains medicinal herbs, namely, mercury and the mallow,
agrimony, with nightshade, and the marigold.‚Äù Master John‚Äôs gardener
had also a garden for his potherbs, in which grew borage, leeks, garlic,
mustard, onions, cibols, and scallions; and in his shrubbery grew pimpernel,
mouseare, selfheal, buglos, adderstongue, and ‚Äúother herbs good for men‚Äôs
bodies.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> Master John had in his fruit-garden, cherry-trees, pear-trees,
apple-trees, plum-trees, quinces, medlars, peaches, chestnuts, nuts, wallnuts,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
figs, and grapes. Walter de Bibblesworth, writing in England
towards the close of the thirteenth century, enumerates as the principal
fruit-trees in a common garden, apples, pears, and cherries&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Pomere, perere, e cerecer</i>;<br /></span>
</span></span>

and adds the plum-tree (<i>pruner</i>), and the quince-tree (<i>coingner</i>).</p>

<p>The cherry, indeed, appears to have been one of the most popular of
fruits in England, during the medi√¶val period. The records of the time
contain purchases of cherry-trees for the king‚Äôs garden in Westminster in
1238 and 1277, and cherries and cherry-trees are enumerated in all the
glossaries from the times of the Anglo-Saxons to the sixteenth century.
The earl of Lincoln had cherry-trees in his garden in Holborn towards
the close of the thirteenth century, and during the same century we have
allusions to the cultivation of the cherry in other parts of the kingdom.
The allusions to cherries in the early poetry are not at all unfrequent, and
they were closely mixed up with popular manners and feelings. It
appears to have been the custom, from a rather early period, to have fairs
or feasts, probably in the cherry orchards, during the period that the fruit
was ripe, which were called cherry-fairs, and sometimes cherry-feasts;
and these are remembered, if they do not still exist, in our great cherry
districts, such as Worcestershire and Kent. They were brief moments of
great gaiety and enjoyment, and the poets loved to quote them as
emblems of the transitory character of all worldly things. In the latter
part of the fourteenth century, the poet Gower, speaking of the teachers
of religion and morality, says:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>They prechen us in audience</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That no man schalle his soule empeyre</i> (impair),<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For alle is but a cherye-fayre</i>.<br /></span>
</span></span>

And the same writer again:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sumtyme I drawe into memoyre,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>How sorow may not ever laste,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And so cometh hope in at laste,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Whan I non other foode knowe;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And that endureth but a throwe,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ryght as it were a chery-feste.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

So again, under the reign of Henry IV., about the year 1411, Occleve, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
his poem ‚ÄúDe regimine principum,‚Äù recently printed for the Roxburgh
Club, says (p. 47),&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Thy lyfe, my sone, is but a chery-feire.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>During the rest of the fifteenth century, the allusions to the cherry-fairs
are very frequent.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> Yet in face of all this, and still more, abundant
evidence, Loudon (‚ÄúEncyclop√¶dia of Gardening,‚Äù edition of 1850) says,
‚ÄúSome suppose that the cherries introduced by the Romans into Britain
were lost, and that they were re-introduced in the time of Henry VIII.
by Richard Haines (it should be Harris), the fruiterer to that monarch.
But though we have no proof that cherries were in England at the time
of the Norman conquest, or for some centuries after it, yet Warton has
proved, by a quotation from Lidgate, a poet who wrote about or before
1415, that the hawkers in London were wont to expose cherries for sale,
in the same manner as is now done early in the season.‚Äù</p>

<p>To turn from the fruit-garden to the flower-garden, modern writers
have fallen into many similar mistakes as to the supposed recent date of
the introduction of various plants into this country. Loudon, for instance,
says that we owe the introduction of the gilliflower, or clove-pink (<i>dianthus
caryophyllus</i>), to the Flemings, who took refuge on our shores from
the savage persecutions of the duke of Alva, in the latter half of the
sixteenth century; whereas this flower was certainly well known, under
the name of gillofres, ages before. Roses, lilies, violets, and periwinkles,
seem to have continued to be the favourite garden-flowers. A manuscript
of the fifteenth century in the British Museum (MS. Sloane, No. 1201)
furnishes us with a list of plants then considered necessary for a garden,
arranged first alphabetically, and then in classes, of which I will here give
verbatim the latter part, as the best illustration of the medi√¶val notion of
a garden, and as being, at the same time, a very complete list. After the
alphabetical list, the manuscript goes on:&mdash;</p>

<p>The processes of gardening were simple and easy, and the gardener‚Äôs
skill consisted chiefly in the knowledge of the seasons for sowing and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
planting different herbs and trees, and of the astrological circumstances
under which these processes could be performed most advantageously.
The great ambition of the medi√¶val horticulturist was to excel in the
various mysteries of grafting, and he entertained theories on this subject
of the most visionary character, many of which were founded on the writings
of the ancients; for the medi√¶val theories were accustomed to select
from the doctrines of antiquity that which was most visionary, and it
usually became still more visionary in their hands. Two English treatises
on gardening were current in the fifteenth century, one founded upon
the Latin treatise of Palladius, and entitled ‚ÄúGodfrey upon Palladie de
Agricultura,‚Äù the other by Nicholas Bollarde, a monk of Westminster&mdash;the
monks were great gardeners. These treatises occur not unfrequently
in manuscripts, and both are found in the British Museum, in the Sloane
MS., No. 7. An abridgment of them was edited by Mr. Halliwell, from
the Porkington manuscript, in a collection of ‚ÄúEarly English Miscellanies,‚Äù
printed for the Warton Club. In these treatises, cherry-trees
appear to have been more than any others the subjects of experiment, and
to have been favourite stocks for grafting. Among the receipts given in
these treatises we may mention those for making cherries grow without
stones, and other fruit without cores; for making the fruit of trees bear
any colour you like; for making old trees young; for making sour fruit
sweet; and ‚Äúto have grapes ripe as soon as pears or cherries.‚Äù This
was to be brought about by grafting the vine on a cherry-tree, according
to the following directions, the spelling of which I modernise:&mdash;‚ÄúSet
a vine by a cherry till it grow, and at the beginning of February
when time is, make a hole through the cherry-tree at what height thou
wilt, and draw through the vine branch so that it fill the hole, and shave
away the old bark of the vine as much as shall be in the hole, and put it
in so that the part shaven fill the hole full, and let it stand a year till they
be ‚Äòsouded‚Äô together, then cut away the root end of the vine, and lap it
with clay round about, and keep it so after other graftings aforesaid.‚Äù
This is from Nicholas Bollarde. Godfrey upon Palladius tells us how
‚Äúto have many roses. Take the hard pepins that be right ripe, and sow
them in February or March, and when they spring, water them well, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
after a year complete thou mayst transplant them; and if thou wilt have
timely (early) roses, delve about the roots one or two handbreadths, and
water their scions with warm water; and for to keep them long, put
them in honeycombs.‚Äù According to the receipts edited by Mr. Halliwell,
‚ÄúIf thou wilt that in the stone of a peach-apple (this was the
ordinary name for a peach) be found a nut-kernel, graft a spring (sprout)
of a peach-tree on the stock of a nut-tree. Also a peach-tree shall bring
forth pomegranates, if it be sprong (sprinkled) oft times with goat‚Äôs milk
three days when it beginneth to flower. Also the apples of a peach-tree
shall wax red, if its scion be grafted on a playne tree.‚Äù Such were the
intellectual vagaries of ‚Äúsuperstitious eld.‚Äù</p>

<p>Peaches are frequently mentioned among the fruit of the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries; but nectarines or apricots are not met with
before the fifteenth century. The latter were called in old English by
their French name of <i>abricots</i>, and subsequently, and still more frequently,
apricocks.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">During</span> the period of which we are treating, the same rough sports
were in vogue among the uneducated classes that had existed for
ages before, and which continued for ages after. Many of these were
trials of strength, such as wrestling and throwing weights, with archery,
and other exercises of that description; others were of a less civilised
character, such as cockfighting and bear and bull-baiting. These latter
were favourite amusements, and there was scarcely a town or village of
any magnitude which had not its bull-ring. It was a municipal enactment
in all towns and cities that no butcher should be allowed to kill a
bull until it had been baited. The bear was an animal in great favour in
the middle ages, and was not only used for baiting, but was tamed and
taught various performances. I have already, in a former chapter, given
an example of a dancing bear
under the Anglo-Saxons; the
accompanying cut (<a href="#n199">No. 199</a>) is
another, taken from a manuscript
of the beginning of the thirteenth
century, in the British
Museum (MS. Arundel. No. 91).</p>

<p>I fear the fact cannot be concealed
that the ladies of former
days assisted not unfrequently at
these rough and unfeminine pastimes. There can be no doubt that they
were customary spectators of the baiting of bulls and bears. Henry VIII.‚Äôs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
two daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, witnessed this coarse amusement, as
we are assured by contemporary writers, with great satisfaction. The
scene represented in our cut <a href="#n200">No. 200</a>, which is copied from one of the
carved seats, of the fourteenth century, in Gloucester cathedral, is chiefly
remarkable for the small degree of energy&mdash;the quiet dignity, in fact&mdash;displayed
by the actors in it.</p>

<p>Hawking and hunting, especially the former, were the favourite
recreations of the upper classes. Hawking was considered so honourable
an occupation, that people were in the custom of carrying the hawk on
their fists when they walked or rode out, when they visited or went to
public assemblies, and even in church, as a mark of their gentility. In
the illuminations we not unfrequently see ladies and gentlemen seated in
conversation, bearing their hawks on their hands. There was generally
a <i>perche</i> in the chamber expressly set aside for the favourite bird, on which
he was placed at night, or by day when the other occupations of its
possessor rendered it inconvenient to carry it
on the hand. Such a <i>perche</i>, with the hawk
upon it, is represented in our cut <a href="#n201">No. 201</a>,
taken from a manuscript of the romance of
‚ÄúMeliadus,‚Äù of the fourteenth century (MS.
Addit. in the British Museum, No. 12,224).
Hawking was in some respects a complicated science; numerous treatises
were written to explain and elucidate it, and it was submitted to strict
laws. Much knowledge and skill were shown in choosing the hawks,
and in breeding and training them, and the value of a well-chosen and
well-trained bird was considerable. When carried about by its master or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
mistress, the hawk was held to the hand by a strap of leather or silk,
called a <i>jesse</i>, which was fitted to the legs of the bird, and passed between
the fingers of the hand. Small bells were also attached to their legs, one
on each. The accompanying cut (<a href="#n202">No. 202</a>),
from a manuscript in the Biblioth√®que
Nationale at Paris (No. 6956), represents
the falconer or keeper of the hawks holding
in one hand what appears to be the jesse;
he has a bird in his right hand, while another
is perched on a short post, which is often
alluded to in the directions for breeding
hawks. The falconer wears hawks‚Äô gloves,
which were made expressly to protect the
hands against the bird‚Äôs talons.</p>

<p>Hawking was a favourite recreation with
the ladies, and in the illuminated manuscripts they often figure in scenes
of this kind. Sometimes they are on foot, as in the group represented in
our cut <a href="#n203">No. 203</a>, taken from a manuscript in the British Museum (MS.
Reg. 2 B. vii.). One lady has let go her hawk, which is in the act of
striking a heron; the other retains her hawk on her hand. The latter,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
as will be seen, is hooded. Each of the ladies who possess hawks has one
glove only&mdash;the hawk‚Äôs glove; the other hand is without gloves. They
took with them, as shown here, dogs in couples to start the game. The
dogs used for this purpose were spaniels, and the old treatise on domestic
affairs entitled ‚ÄúLe M√©nagier de Paris,‚Äù gives particular directions for
choosing them. In the illuminations, hawking parties are more frequently
represented on horseback than on foot; and often there is a mixture of
riders and pedestrians. The treatise just referred to directs that the horse
for hawking should be a low one, easy to mount and dismount, and very
quiet, that he may go slowly, and show no restiveness. Hawking appears
to have commenced at the beginning of August; and until the middle of
that month it was confined almost entirely to partridges. Quails, we are
told, came in in the middle of August, and from that time forward
everything seems to have been considered game that came to hand, for
when other birds fail, the ladies are told that they may hunt fieldfares,
and even jays and magpies. September and October were the busiest
hawking months.</p>

<p>Hawking was, indeed, a favourite diversion with the ladies, and they
not only accompanied the gentlemen to this sport, but frequently engaged
in it alone. The hawking of the ladies, however, appears to have been
especially that of herons and water-fowl; and this was called going to the
river (<i>aller en rivi√®re</i>), and was very commonly pursued on foot. It may
be mentioned that the fondness of the ladies for the diversion of hawking
is alluded to in the twelfth century by John of Salisbury. The hawking
on the river, indeed, seems to have been that particular branch of the
sport which gave most pleasure to all classes, and it is that which is
especially represented in the drawings in the Anglo-Saxon manuscripts.
Dogs were commonly used in hawking to rouse the game in the same
manner as at the present day, but in hawking on the river, where dogs
were of course less effective, other means were adopted. In a manuscript
already quoted in the present chapter (MS. Reg. 2 B. vii.), of the
beginning of the fourteenth century, a group of ladies hawking on the
banks of a river are accompanied by a man, perhaps the falconer, who
makes a noise to rouse the water-fowl. Our cut <a href="#n204">No. 204</a> is taken from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
a very interesting manuscript of the fourteenth century, made for the
monastery of St. Bartholomew, in Smithfield, and now preserved in the
library of the British Museum (MS. Reg. 10 E. iv.); it is part of a scene
in which ladies are hawking on a river, and a female is rousing the water-fowl
with a tabor. The fountain is one of those conventional objects by
which the medi√¶val artist indicated a spring, or running stream. This
seems to have been a very common method of rousing the game; and it
is represented in one of the carved seats, or misereres (as they have been
termed technically), in Gloucester cathedral, which is copied in our cut
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
No. 205. This scene is rather curiously illustrated by an anecdote told
by an old chronicler, Ralph de Diceto, of a man who went to the river
to hunt teal with his hawk, and roused them with ‚Äúwhat is called by the
river-hawkers a tabor.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> The tending of the hawks used in these diversions
was no slight occupation in the medi√¶val household, and was the
subject of no little study; they were cherished with the utmost care, and
carried about familiarly on the wrist in all places and under all sorts of
circumstances. It was a common practice, indeed, to go to church with
the hawk on the wrist. One of the early French poets, Gaces de la
Buigne, who wrote a metrical treatise on hunting in the middle of the
fourteenth century, advises his readers to carry their hawks with them
wherever there were assemblies of people, whether in churches or elsewhere&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>L√† o√π les gens sont amass√©s,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Soit en l‚Äô√©glise, ou autre part.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

This is explained more fully by the author of the ‚ÄúM√©nagier de
Paris‚Äù (vol. ii. p. 296), who wrote especially for the instruction of the
female members of his family. ‚ÄúAt this point of falconry,‚Äù he says,
‚Äúit is advisable more than ever to hold the hawk on the wrist, and to
carry it to the pleadings (courts of justice), and among people to the
churches, and in other assemblies, and in the streets, and to hold it day and
night as continually as possible, and sometimes to perch it in the streets,
that it may see people, horses, carts, dogs, and become acquainted with
all things.... And sometimes, in the house, let it be perched on the
dogs, that the dogs may see it, and it them.‚Äù It was thus that the
practice of carrying a hawk on the wrist became a distinction of people
of gentle blood. The annexed engraving (<a href="#n206">No. 206</a>), taken from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
same manuscript last quoted (MS. Reg. 10 E. iv.), represents a lady
tending her hawks, which are seated on their ‚Äúperche.‚Äù</p>

<p>The author of the ‚ÄúM√©nagier de Paris,‚Äù a little farther on than the
place last quoted (p. 311), goes on to say, ‚ÄúAt the end of the month of
September, and after, when hawking
of quails and partridges is over, and
even in winter, you may hawk at
magpies, at jackdaws, at teal, which
are in river, or others, ... at blackbirds,
thrushes, jays, and woodcocks;
and for this purpose you may carry a
bow and a bolt, in order that, when
the blackbird takes shelter in a bush,
and dare not quit it for the hawk
which hovers over and watches it,
the lady or damsel who knows how
to shoot may kill it with the bolt.‚Äù
The manuscript which has furnished
us with the preceding illustrations gives us the accompanying sketch
(<a href="#n207">No. 207</a>) of a lady shooting with her bolt, or <i>boujon</i> (as it was termed in
French),&mdash;an arrow with a large head, for striking birds; but in this
instance she is aiming not at birds, but at rabbits. Archery was also a
favourite recreation with the ladies in the middle ages, and it no doubt is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
in itself an extremely good exercise, in a gymnastic point of view. The
fair shooters seem to have employed bolts more frequently than the
sharp-headed arrows; but there is no want of examples in the illuminated
manuscripts in which females are represented as using the sharp-headed
arrow, and sometimes they are seen shooting at deer. This custom prevailed
during a long period, and is alluded to not unfrequently at so
late a date as the sixteenth century. We learn from Leland‚Äôs ‚ÄúCollectanea‚Äù
(vol. iv. p. 278), that when the princess Margaret, daughter of
Henry VII., was on her way to Scotland, a hunting-party was got up
for her in the park at Alnwick, and that she killed a buck with an arrow.
Similar feats were at times performed by queen Elizabeth; but she seems
to have preferred the cross-bow to the long-bow. The scene represented
in our cut <a href="#n208">No. 208</a> is from the same manuscript; the relative proportions
of the dog and the rabbit seem to imply a satirical aim. Our next cut
(<a href="#n209">No. 209</a>), taken from MS. Reg. 2 B. vii., represents ladies hunting the
stag. One, on horseback, is winding the horn and starting the game, in
which the other plants her arrow most skilfully and scientifically. The
dog used on this occasion is intended to be a greyhound.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 209. Ladies Hunting the Stag.</i></p></div>

<p>It must be remarked that, in all the illuminations of the period we
are describing, which represent ladies engaged in hunting or hawking,
when on horseback they are invariably and unmistakeably represented
riding astride. This is evidently the case in this group (<a href="#n209">No. 209</a>). It has
been already shown, in former chapters, that from a very early period it
was a usual custom with the ladies to ride sideways, or with side-saddles.
Most of the medi√¶val artists were so entirely ignorant of perspective, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
they were so much tied to conventional modes of representing things,
that when, no doubt, they intended to represent ladies riding sideways,
the latter seem often as if they were riding astride. But in many instances,
and especially in the scenes of hunting and hawking, there can be no
doubt that they were riding in the latter fashion; and it is probable that
they were taught to ride both ways, the side-saddle being considered the
most courtly, while it was considered safer to sit astride in the chase.
A passage has been often quoted from Gower‚Äôs ‚ÄúConfessio Amantis,‚Äù in
which a troop of ladies is described, all mounted on fair white ambling
horses, with splendid saddles, and it is added that ‚Äúeverichone (<i>every one</i>)
ride on side,‚Äù which probably means that this was the most fashionable
style of riding. But, as shown in a former chapter (p. 72), it has been
rather hastily assumed that this is a proof that it was altogether a new
fashion. Our next cut (<a href="#n210">No. 210</a>), taken from a manuscript in the French
National Library (No. 7178), of the fourteenth century, represents two
ladies riding in the modern fashion, except that the left leg appears to be
raised very awkwardly; but this appearance we must perhaps ascribe only
to the bad drawing. It must be observed also that these ladies are seated
on the wrong side of the horse, which is probably an error of the
draughtsman. Perhaps there was a different arrangement of the dress
for the two modes of riding, although there was so little of what we now
call delicacy in the medi√¶val manners, that this would be by no means
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
necessary. Chaucer describes the Wife of Bath as wearing spurs, and as
enveloped in a ‚Äúfoot-mantle:‚Äù&mdash;</p>

<p>Travelling on horseback was now more common than at an earlier
period, and this was not unfrequently a subject of popular complaint. In
fact, men who rode on horseback considered themselves much above the
pedestrians; they often went in companies, and were generally accompanied
with grooms, and other riotous followers, who committed all sorts
of depredations and violence on the peasantry in their way. A satirical
song of the latter end of the reign of Edward I., represents our Saviour as
discouraging the practice of riding. ‚ÄúWhile God was on earth,‚Äù says the
writer, ‚Äúand wandered wide, what was the reason he would not ride?
Because he would not have a groom to go by his side, nor the grudging
(or discontent) of any gadling to jaw or to chide:‚Äù&mdash;</p>

<p>The clergy were great riders, and
abbots and monks are not unfrequently
figured on horseback. Our cut <a href="#n211">No. 211</a>
(from MS. Cotton, Nero, D. vii.) represents
an abbot riding, with a hat over
his hood; he is giving his benediction
in return to the salute of some passing
traveller.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img id="n212" src="images/i_n212.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 212. A Knight and his Steed.</i></p></div>

<p>The knight still carried his spear with him in travelling, as the footman
carried his staff. In our cut <a href="#n212">No. 212</a>, from a manuscript of the
fourteenth century in the Biblioth√®que
Nationale in Paris (No. 6963), the rider,
though not armed, carries his spear
with him. The saddle in this instance
is singularly and rather rudely formed.
It was a great point of vanity in the
middle ages in England to hang the
caparisons of the horse with small bells,
which made a jingling noise. In the
romance of ‚ÄúRichard C≈ìur de Lion‚Äù
(Weber ii. 60), a messenger coming to king Richard has no less than
five hundred such bells suspended to his horse&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>His trappys wer off tuely sylke,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With five hundred belles rygande.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>

And again, in the same romance (vol. ii. p. 223), we are told, in speaking
of the sultan of ‚ÄúDamas,‚Äù that his horse was well furnished in this
respect&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>And hys peytrel, and hys arsoun;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Three myle myghte men here the soun.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The bridle, however, was the part of the harness usually loaded with bells,
and, according to Chaucer, it was a vanity especially affected by the
monks; for the poet tells us of his monk, that&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Whan he rood, men might his bridel heere</i><br /></span>

The rider is seldom furnished with a whip, because he urged his steed
forward with his spurs; but female riders and persons of lower degree
have often whips, which generally
consist of several lashes, each having
usually a knob at the end. Such a
whip is seen in our cut <a href="#n213">No. 213</a>,
taken from a manuscript of the thirteenth
century in the British Museum
(MS. Arundel. No. 91), which represents
a countryman driving a horse
of burthen; and he not only uses
the whip, but he tries further to urge
him on by twisting his tail. A whip
with one lash&mdash;rather an unusual
example&mdash;is in the hand of the
woman driving the cart in our cut <a href="#n214">No. 214</a>, which is taken from a
manuscript of the romance of ‚ÄúMeliadus,‚Äù in the French National Library
(No. 6961), belonging to the fourteenth century. The lady here is also
evidently riding astride. The cart in which she is carrying home the
wounded knight is of a simple and rude construction. As yet, indeed,
carriages for travelling were very little in use; and to judge by the
illuminations, they were only employed for kings and very powerful
nobles in ceremonial processions.</p>

<p>The horse was, after a man‚Äôs own limbs, his primary agent of locomotion.
Perhaps no animal is so intimately mixed up with the history of
mankind as the horse&mdash;certainly none more so. Our Anglo-Saxon forefathers
travelled much on foot, and, as far as we know, the great importance
in which the horse was held in the middle ages in this part of the
world, began with feudalism, and the best and most celebrated breed of
horses in Europe, from the earliest ages of chivalry, was brought from the
East. The heroes of early romance and poetry are generally mounted on
<i>Arab</i> steeds, and these have often the additional merit of having been
won by conquest from the Saracens. In the thirteenth century they
were obtained from Turkey and Greece; and at a later period from
Barbary. France, also, had its native breed, which enjoyed a high reputation
for many valuable qualities, and especially for its fierceness in war;
Gascony, and, on the other side of the Spanish frontier, Castile and
Aquitaine, were much celebrated for their horses. The Gascons prided
themselves much on their horses, and they displayed this pride sometimes
in a very singular manner. In 1172, Raymond de Venous, count of
Toulouse, held a grand <i>cour pl√©ni√®re</i>, and, as a display of ostentation,
caused thirty of his horses to be burnt in presence of the assembly. It
was a fine example of the barbarity of feudalism. At the provincial
synod of Auch, held in 1303, it was ordered that archdeacons, when they
made their diocesan circuits, should not go with more than five horses,
which shows that the Gascon clergy were in the habit of making a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
display of cavalry. It appears that at this early period the best horses
were imported into England from Bordeaux. It may be mentioned, in
passing, that the male horse only was ridden by knights or people of
any distinction, and that to ride a mare was always looked upon as a
degradation. This seems to have been an old Teutonic prejudice, perhaps
a religious superstition.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n214" src="images/i_n214.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 214. Lady and Cart.</i></p></div>

<p>The kinds of horses most commonly mentioned in the feudal ages are
named in French (which was the language of feudalism), the <i>palefroi</i>, or
palfrey, the <i>dextrier</i>, the <i>roncin</i>, and the <i>sommier</i>. The <i>dextrier</i>, or
<i>destrier</i>, was the ordinary war-horse; the <i>roncin</i> belonged especially to
the servants and attendants; and the <i>sommier</i> carried the luggage. Ladies
especially rode the palfrey. The Orkney islands appear to have been
celebrated for their <i>dextriers</i>. The Isle of Man seems also to have produced
a celebrated breed of horses. Brittany was celebrated for its palfreys.
The <i>haquen√©e</i>, or hackney, of the middle ages, appears to have been
especially reserved for females. England seems not to have been celebrated
for its horses in the middle ages, and the horses of value possessed
by the English kings and great nobles were, in almost all cases, imported
from the Continent. The ordinary prices of horses in England in the
reign of Edward I., was from one to ten pounds, but choice animals were
valued much higher. When St. Louis returned to France from his
captivity, the abbot of Cluny presented to the king and the queen each
a horse, the value of which Joinville estimates at five hundred livres,
equivalent to about four hundred pounds of our present English money.
These must have been horses which possessed some very extraordinary
qualities, as the price is quite out of proportion to that of other horses at
the same period. In the charters published by M. Gu√©rard, horses are
valued at forty sols, and at three pounds at various periods during the
eleventh century. In 1202, two <i>roncins</i> are valued at thirty sols each,
another at forty, two at fifty each, and two at sixty; the <i>roncin</i> of an
arbalester at sixty sols; a <i>sommier</i>, or baggage-horse, at forty sols; and
three horses, of which the kind is not specified, at six pounds each.
These appear to have been the ordinary prices at that period; for, though
prices of horses are mentioned as high as thirty-four, thirty-five, and forty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
pounds, these were only possessed or given as presents by kings. The
value of horses went on rising through the thirteenth century, until
Philippe le Hardi found it necessary to fix it by an <i>ordonnance</i>, which
limited the price which any man, whether lay or clergy, however rich,
might give for a palfrey, to sixty pounds <i>tournois</i>, and that to be given by
a squire for a <i>roncin</i> to twenty pounds. The prices of horses appear not
to have varied much from this during the fourteenth century. In the
middle of the century following the prices rose much higher.</p>

<p>Of the colours of horses, in the middle ages, white seems to have been
prized most highly, and after that dapple-gray and bay or chestnut. The
same colours were in favour among the Arabs. One of the poets of the
thirteenth century, Jean Bodel, describes a choice Gascon horse as
follows:&mdash;‚ÄúHis hair,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúwas more shining than the plumage of
a peacock; his head was lean, his eye gray like a falcon, his breast large
and square, his crupper broad, his thigh round, and his rump tight. They
who saw it said that they had never seen a handsomer animal.‚Äù The
food given to horses in the middle ages seems to have been much the
same as at the present day. In 1435 the queen of Navarre gave carrots
to her horses. Although the medi√¶val knight resembled the Arab in his
love for his horse, yet the latter was often treated hardly and even cruelly,
and the practice of horsemanship was painful to the rider and to the
horse. To be a skilful rider was a first-rate accomplishment. One of the
feats of horsemanship practised ordinarily was to jump into the saddle, in
full armour:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>No foot Fitzjames in stirrup staid,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>No grasp upon the saddle laid;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But wreath‚Äôd his left hand in the mane,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And lightly bounded from the plain.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Though horse-races are mentioned in two of the earliest of the French
metrical romances, those of ‚ÄúRenaud de Montauban,‚Äù and of ‚ÄúAiol,‚Äù
they seem never to have been practised in France until very recently,
when they were introduced in imitation of the English fashion. Post-horses
were first introduced in France during the reign of Henry II., that
is, in the middle of the sixteenth century.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span></p>

<p>Great importance was placed in the breeding of horses in the middle
ages. Charlemagne, in the regulations for the administration of his
private domains, gives particular directions for the care of his brood-mares
and stallions. Normandy appears to have been famous for its studs of
horses in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and documents show that
the monks took good care rigorously to exact the tithes of their produce
to stock the monastic stables. Traces of the existence of similar studs are
found also in other parts of France. At this time a horse was considered
the handsomest present that could be made by a king or a great lord, and
horses were often given as bribes. Thus, in 1227, the monks of the
abbey of Troarn obtained from Guillaume de Tilli the ratification of a
grant made to them by his father in consideration of a gift to him of
a mark of silver and a palfrey; and the monks of St. Evroul, in 1165,
purchased a favour of the English earl of Gloucester by presenting to him
two palfreys estimated to be worth twenty pounds of money of Anjou.
Kings frequently received horses as presents from their subjects. The
widow of Herbert du Mesnil gave king John of England a palfrey to
obtain the wardship of her children; and one Geoffrey Fitz-Richard gave
the same monarch a palfrey for a concession in the forest of Beaulieu. In
1172, Raimond, count of St. Gilles, having become the vassal of the king
of England, engaged to pay him an annual tribute of a hundred marks of
silver, or ten <i>dextriers</i>, worth at least ten marks each. The English studs
appear already in the thirteenth century to have become remarkable for
their excellence.</p>

<p>Travelling, in the middle ages, was assisted by few, it any, conveniences,
and was dangerous as well as difficult. The insecurity of the
roads made it necessary for travellers to associate together for protection,
as well as for company, for their journeys were slow and dull; and as
they were often obliged to halt for the night where there was little or no
accommodation, they had to carry a good deal of luggage. An inn was
often the place of rendezvous for travellers starting upon the same journey.
It is thus that Chaucer represents himself as having taken up his quarters
at the Tabard, in Southwark, preparatory to undertaking the journey to
Canterbury; and at night there arrived a company of travellers bent to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
the same destination, who had gathered together as they came along the
road:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>At night was come into that hostelrie</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Wel nyne and twenty in a companye,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>In felaschipe.</i><br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Cant. Tales, l. 23.<br /></span>
</span></span>

Chaucer obtains the consent of the rest to his joining their fellowship,
which, as he describes it, consisted of persons most dissimilar in class and
character. The host of the Tabard joins the party also, and it is agreed
that, to enliven the journey, each, in his turn, shall tell a story on the
way. They then sup at a common table, drink wine, and go to bed;
and at daybreak they start on their journey. They travelled evidently
at a slow pace; and at Boughton-under-Blee&mdash;a village a few miles from
Canterbury&mdash;a canon and his yeoman, after some hard riding, overtake
them, and obtain permission to join the company. It would seem that
the company had passed a night somewhere on the road, probably at
Rochester,&mdash;and we should, perhaps, have had an account of their
reception and departure, had the collection of the ‚ÄúCanterbury Tales‚Äù
been completed by their author,&mdash;and that the canon sent his yeoman
to watch for any company of travellers who should halt at the hostelry,
that he might join them, but he had been too late to start with them,
and had, therefore, ridden hard to overtake them:&mdash;

<p>The road-side ale-house, where drink was sold to travellers, and to
the country-people of the neighbourhood, was scattered over the more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
populous and frequented parts of the country from an early period, and is
not unfrequently alluded to in popular writers. It was indicated by a
stake projecting from the house, on which some object was hung for a
sign, and is sometimes represented in the illuminations of manuscripts.
Our cut <a href="#n215">No. 215</a>, taken from a manuscript of the fourteenth century,
in the British Museum (MS. Reg. 10
E. iv.), represents one of those ale-houses,
at which a pilgrim is halting
to take refreshment. The keeper of
the ale-house, in this instance, is a
woman, the ale-wife, and the stake
appears to be a besom. In another
(<a href="#n216">No. 216</a>), taken from a manuscript
copy of the ‚ÄúMoralization of Chess,‚Äù
by Jacques de Cessoles, of the earlier
part of the fifteenth century (MS. Reg.
19 C. xi.), a round sign is suspended on
the stake, with a figure in the middle,
which may possibly be intended to represent
a bush. A garland was not
unfrequently hung upon the stake; on this Chaucer, describing his
‚Äúsompnour,‚Äù says:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

</span></span>

A bush was still more common, and gave rise to the proverb that ‚Äúgood

<p class="caption"><i>No. 217. The Canterbury Pilgrims.</i></p></div>

<p>Lydgate composed his poem of the ‚ÄúStorie of Thebes,‚Äù as a continuation
of Chaucer‚Äôs ‚ÄúCanterbury Tales,‚Äù and in the prologue he
describes himself as arriving in Canterbury, while the pilgrims were
there, and accidentally taking up his lodging at the same inn. He thus
seeks and obtains permission to be one of the fellowship, and returns from
Canterbury in their company. Our cut <a href="#n217">No. 217</a>, taken from a fine
manuscript of Lydgate‚Äôs poem (MS. Reg. 18 D. ii.), represents the pilgrims
leaving Canterbury, and is not only a good illustration of the
practice of travelling in companies, but it furnishes us with a characteristic
picture of a medi√¶val town.</p>

<p>This readiness of travellers to join company with each other was not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
confined to any class of society, but was general among them all, and not
unfrequently led to the formation of friendships and alliances between
those who had previously been strangers to one another. In the interesting
romance of ‚ÄúBlonde of Oxford,‚Äù composed in the thirteenth century,
when Jean of Dammartin came to seek his fortune in England, and was
riding from Dover to London, attended by a faithful servant, he overtook
the earl of Oxford, who was on his way to London, with a numerous
retinue of armed followers. Jean, having learnt from the earl‚Äôs followers
who he was, introduced himself to him, and was finally taken into his
service. Subsequently, in the same romance, Jean of Dammartin, returning
to England, takes up his lodging in a handsome hotel in London, and
while his man Robin puts the horses in the stable, he walks out into the
street, and sees a large company who had just arrived, consisting of squires,
servants, knights, clerks, priests, serving-lads (<i>gar√ßons</i>), and men who
attended the baggage horses (<i>sommiers</i>). Jean asked one of the esquires
who they all were, what was their business, and where they were going;
and was informed that it was the earl of Gloucester, who had come to
London about some business, and was going on the morrow to Oxford, to
be married to the lady Blonde, the object of Jean‚Äôs affections. Next
morning the earl began his journey at daybreak, and Jean and his
servant, who were mounted ready, joined the company. There was so
little unusual in this, that the intruders seem, for a while, not to have
been noticed, until, at length, the earl observed Jean, and began to
interrogate him: ‚ÄúFriend,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúyou are welcome; what is your
name?‚Äù&mdash;

</span></span>

Jean gave him an assumed name, said he was a merchant, and offered to
sell the earl his horse, but they could not agree upon the terms. They
continued conversing together during the rest of the journey. As they
proceeded they encountered a shower of rain, which wetted the earl, who
was fashionably and thinly clothed. Jean smiled at the impatience with
which he seemed to bear this mishap, and when asked to tell the cause
of his mirth, said, ‚ÄúIf I were a rich man, like you, I should always carry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
a house with me, so that I could go into it when the rain came, and not
get my clothes dirtied and wet.‚Äù The earl and his followers set Jean
down for a fool, and looked forward to be made merry by him. Soon
afterwards they came to the banks of a river, into which the earl rode,
without first ascertaining if it were fordable, and he was carried away by
the stream, and only saved from drowning by a fisherman in a boat. The
rest of the company found a ford, where they passed the river without
danger. The earl‚Äôs clothes had now been completely soaked in the
water, and, as his baggage-horses were too far in the rear, he made one
of his knights strip, and give him his dry clothes, and left him to make
the best of his wet ones. ‚ÄúIf I were as rich, and had so many men, as
you,‚Äù said Jean, laughing again, ‚ÄúI would not be exposed to misfortunes
of this kind, for I would carry a bridge with me.‚Äù The earl and his
retinue were merry again, at what they supposed to be the folly of their
travelling companion. They were now near Oxford, and Jean took his
leave of the earl of Gloucester. We learn, in the course of the story,
that all that Jean meant by the house, was that the earl ought to have
had at hand a good cloak and cape to cover his fine clothes in case of
rain; and that, by the bridge, he intended to intimate that he ought to
have sent some of his men to ascertain the depth of the river before he
went into it!</p>

<p>These illustrations of the manner and inconveniences of travelling
apply more especially to those who could travel on horseback; but the
difficulties were still greater for the numerous class of people who were
obliged to travel on foot, and who could rarely make sure of reaching, at
the end of each day‚Äôs journey, a place where they could obtain a lodging.
They, moreover, had also to take with them a certain quantity of
baggage. Foot-travellers seem to have had sometimes a mule or a
donkey, to carry luggage, or for the weak women and children. Every
one will remember the medi√¶val fable of the old man and his ass, in
which a father and his son have the one ass between them. In medi√¶val
illuminations representing the flight into Egypt, Joseph is often represented
as walking, while the Virgin and Child ride upon an ass which he
is leading. The party of foot-travellers in our cut <a href="#n218">No. 218</a>, taken from a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
manuscript of the beginning of the fourteenth century (MS. Reg. 2 B.
vii.), forms part of a group representing the relatives of Thomas Beckett
driven into exile by king Henry II.; they are making their way to the
sea-shore on foot, perhaps to show that they were not of very high condition
in life.</p>

<p>In Chaucer, it is a matter of surprise that the ‚Äúchanoun‚Äù had so
little luggage that he carried only a
male, or portmanteau, on his horse‚Äôs
crupper, and even that was doubled
up (<i>tweyfold</i>) on account of its emptiness:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>A male tweyfold on his croper lay,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Al light for somer rood this worthy man.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i22">&mdash;Cant. Tales, l. 12,494.<br /></span>
</span></span>

On the contrary, in the romance of
‚ÄúBerte,‚Äù when the heroine is left to
wander in the solitary forest, the
writer laments that she had ‚Äúneither
pack-horse laden with coffers, nor clothes folded up in males,‚Äù which
were the ordinary accompaniments of travellers of any consequence:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>N‚Äôi ot sommier √† coffres ne dras trouss√©s en male.</i><br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Roman de Berte, p. 42.<br /></span>
</span></span>

A traveller, indeed, had many things to carry with him. He took provisions
with him, or was obliged, at times, to reckon on what he could
kill, or obtain undressed, and hence he was obliged to carry cooking
apparatus with him. He carried flint and steel to strike a light, and be
able to make a fire, as he might have to bivouac in a solitary place, or in
the midst of a forest. In the romance of ‚ÄúGarin le Loherain,‚Äù when the
count Begues of Belin finds himself benighted in the forest, he prepares
for passing the night comfortably, and, as a matter of course, draws out
his flint (<i>fusil</i>), and lights a fire:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Et li quens est desous l‚Äôarbre ram√©;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Prent son fusil, s‚Äôa le fu alum√©,</i><br /></span>

<span class="author">&mdash;Garin le Loherain, ii., p. 231.<br /></span>
</span></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>

The traveller also often carried materials for laying a bed, if benighted on
the road; and he had, above all, to take sufficient money with him in
specie. He sometimes also carried a portable tent with him, or materials
for making one. In the English romance of ‚ÄúIpomydon‚Äù (Weber, ii.
343), the maiden messenger of the heiress of Calabria carries her tent
with her, and usually lodges at night under it&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>Mete and drynke bothe they had,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That was fro home with them lad.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

It may be remarked that in this story the first thought of every gallant
knight who passes is to treat the lady with violence. All these incumbrances,
combined with the badness of the roads, rendered travelling slow&mdash;of
which we might quote abundant examples. At the end of the
twelfth century, it took Giraldus Cambrensis four days to travel from
Powisland to Haughmond Abbey, near Shrewsbury. The roads, too,
were infested with robbers and banditti, and travellers were only safe in
their numbers, and in being sufficiently well armed to repel attacks. In
the accompanying cut (<a href="#n219">No. 219</a>), from a manuscript of the fourteenth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
century (MS. Reg. 10 E. iv.), a traveller is taking his repose under a
tree,&mdash;it is, perhaps, intended to be understood that he is passing the
night in a wood,&mdash;while he is plundered by robbers, who are here jokingly
represented in the forms of monkeys. While one is emptying his
‚Äúmale‚Äù or box, the other is carrying off his girdle, with the large pouch
attached to it, in which, no doubt, the traveller carried his money, and
perhaps his eatables. The insecurity of the roads in the middle ages was,
indeed, very great, for not only were the forests filled with bands of outlaws,
who stripped all who fell into their hands, but the knights and landed
gentry, and even noblemen, took to the highways not unfrequently, and
robbed unscrupulously. Moreover, they built their castles near difficult
passes, or by a river where there was a bridge or ford, and where, therefore,
they commanded it, and there they levied arbitrary taxes on all who
passed, and, on the slightest attempt at resistance, plundered the traveller
of his property, and put him to death or threw him into their dungeons.
Incidents of this kind are common in the medi√¶val romances and stories.
Piers de Bruville, in the history of Fulke Fitz-Warine, may be mentioned
as an example of this class of marauders. ‚ÄúAt that time,‚Äù says the story,
‚Äúthere was a knight in the country who was called Piers de Bruville.
This Piers used to collect all the sons of gentlemen of the country who
were wild, and other ribald people, and used to go about the country, and
slew and robbed loyal people, merchants, and others.‚Äù In the fabliau of
the ‚ÄúChevalier au Barizel,‚Äù we are told of a great baron who issued continually
from his strong castle to plunder the country around. ‚ÄúHe
watched so closely the roads, that he slew all the pilgrims, and plundered
the merchants; many of them he brought to mishap. He spared neither
clergy nor monk, recluse, hermit, or canon; and the nuns and lay-sisters
he caused to live in open shame, when he had them in his power; and
he spared neither dames nor maids, of whatever rank or class, whether
poor or rich, or well educated or simple, but he put them all to open
shame‚Äù (Barbazan, i. 209).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n219" src="images/i_n219.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 219. Plundering a Traveller.</i></p></div>

<p>The roads, in the middle ages, appear also to have been infested with
beggars of all descriptions, many of whom were cripples, and persons
mutilated in the most revolting manner, the result of feudal wantonness,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
and of feudal vengeance. Our cut <a href="#n220">No. 220</a>, also furnished by a manuscript
of the fourteenth century, represents a very deformed cripple, whose
means of locomotion are rather
curious. The beggar and the
cripple, too, were often only
robbers in disguise, who waited
their opportunity to attack single
passengers, or who watched to
give notice to comrades of the
approach of richer convoys. The
medi√¶val popular stories give
abundant instances of robbers and others disguising themselves as beggars
and cripples. Blindness, also, was common among these objects of commiseration
in the middle ages; often, as in the case of mutilation of
other kinds, the result of deliberate violence. The same manuscript
I have so often quoted (MS. Reg. 10 E. iv.), has furnished our cut No.
221, representing a blind man and his dog.</p>

<p>It will be easily understood, that when travelling was beset with so
many inconveniences, private hospitality would be looked upon as one of
the first of virtues, for people were often obliged to have recourse to it,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
and it was seldom refused. In the country every man‚Äôs door was open
to the stranger who came from a distance, unless his appearance were
suspicious or threatening. In this there was a mutual advantage; for the
guest generally brought with him news and information which was highly
valued at a time when communication between one place and another
was so slow and uncertain. Hence the first questions put to a stranger
were, whence he had come, and what news he had brought with him.
The old romances and tales furnish us with an abundance of examples of
the widespread feeling of hospitality that prevailed during the middle
ages. Even in the middle and lower classes, people were always ready to
share their meals with the stranger who asked for a lodging. The denial
of such hospitality was looked upon as exceptional and disgraceful, and
was only met with from misers and others who were regarded as
almost without the pale of society. The early metrical story of ‚ÄúThe
Hermit,‚Äù the foundation of Parnell‚Äôs poem, gives us examples of the
different sorts of hospitality with which travellers met. The hermit and
his companion began their travels in a wild country, and at the end of
their first day‚Äôs journey, they were obliged to take up their lodgings with
another hermit, who gave them the best welcome he could, and shared
his provisions with them. The next evening they came to a city, where
everybody shut his door against them, because they were poor, till at
length, weary and wet with rain, they sat down on the stone steps of a
great mansion; but the host was an usurer, and refused to receive into his
house men who promised him so little profit. Yet at length, to escape
their importunities, he allowed them to enter the yard, and sleep under a
staircase, where his maid threw them some straw to lie upon, but neither
offered them refreshment, except some of the refuse of the table, nor
allowed them to go to a fire to dry their clothes. The next evening they
sought their lodging in a large abbey, where the monks received them
with great hospitality, and gave them plenty to eat and drink. On the
fourth day they came to another town, where they went to the house of
a rich and honest burgher, who also received them with all the marks
of hospitality. Their host washed their feet, and gave them plenty to
eat and drink, and they were comfortably lodged for the night.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span></p>

<p>It would not be difficult to illustrate all the incidents of this story by
anecdotes of medi√¶val life. The traveller who sought a lodging, without
money to pay for it, even in private houses, was not always well received.
In the fabliau of the ‚ÄúButcher of Abbeville‚Äù (Barbazan, iv. 1), the
butcher, returning from the market of Oisemont, is overtaken by night at
the small town of Bailleuil. He determined to stop for the night there,
and, seeing a poor woman at her door, at the entrance of the town, he
inquired where he could ask for a night‚Äôs lodging, and she recommended
him to the priest, as the only person in the town who had wine in his
cellar. The butcher accordingly repaired to the priest‚Äôs house, where he
found that ecclesiastic sitting on the sill of his door, and asked him to give
him a lodging for the sake of charity. The priest, who thought that
there was nothing to be gained from him, refused, telling him he would
find plenty of people in the town who could give him a bed. As the
butcher was leaving the town, irritated by his inhospitable reception, he
encountered a flock of sheep, which he learnt were the property of the
priest; whereupon, selecting the fattest of them, he dextrously stole it
away unperceived, and, returning with it into the town, he went to the
priest‚Äôs door, found him just closing his house, for it was nightfall, and
again asked him for lodging. The priest asked him who he was, and
whence he came. He replied that he had been to the market at
Oisemont, and bought a sheep; that he was overtaken by night, and
sought a lodging; and that, as it was no great consideration to him, he
intended to kill his sheep, and share it with his host. The temptation
was too great for the greedy priest, and he now received the butcher into
his house, treated him with great respect, and had a bed made for him in
his hall. Now the priest had&mdash;as was common with the Catholic priesthood&mdash;a
concubine and a maid-servant, and they all regaled themselves
on the butcher‚Äôs sheep. Before the guest left next morning, he contrived
to sell the sheep‚Äôs skin and wool for certain considerations severally to the
concubine and to the maid, and, after his departure, their rival claims led
to a quarrel, and even to a battle. While the priest, on his return from
the service of matins, was labouring to appease the combatants, his shepherd
entered, with the information that his best sheep had been stolen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
from his flock, and an examination of the skin led to the discovery of the
trick which had been played upon him&mdash;a punishment, as we are told,
which he well merited by his inhospitable conduct. A Latin story of the
thirteenth century may be coupled with the foregoing anecdote. There
was an abbot who was very miserly and inhospitable, and he took care to
give all the offices in the abbey to men of his own character. This was
especially the case with the monk who had the direction of the <i>hospitium</i>,
or guest-house. One day came a minstrel to ask for a lodging, but he
met with an unfriendly reception, was treated only with black bread and
water to drink, and was shown to a hard bed of straw. Minstrels were
not usually treated in this inhospitable manner, and our guest resolved to
be revenged. He left the abbey next morning, and a little way on his
journey he met the abbot, who was returning home from a short absence.
‚ÄúGod bless you, good abbot!‚Äù he said, ‚Äúfor the noble hospitality which
has been shown to me this night by your monks. The master of your
guest-house treated me with the choicest wines, and placed rich dishes on
the table for me in such numbers, that I would not attempt to count
them; and when I came away this morning, he gave me a pair of shoes,
a girdle, and a knife.‚Äù The abbot hurried home in a furious rage, summoned
the offending brother before a chapter, accused him of squandering
away the property of the monastery, caused him to be flogged and dismissed
from his office, and appointed in his place another, in whose
inhospitable temper he could place entire confidence.</p>

<p>These cases of want of hospitality were, however, exceptions to the
general rule. A stranger was usually received with great kindness, each
class of society, of course, more or less by its own class, though, under
such circumstances, much less distinction of class was made than we might
suppose. The aristocratic class, which included what we should now call
the gentry, sought hospitality in the nearest castle; for a castle, as a
matter of pride and ostentation, was, more or less, like an abbey, a place
of hospitality for everybody. Among the richer and more refined classes,
great care was taken to show proper courtesy to strangers, according to
their rank. In the case of a knight, the lord of the house and his lady,
with their damsels, led him into a private room, took off his armour, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
often his clothes, and gave him a change of apparel, after careful ablution.
A scene of this kind is represented in the accompanying cut (<a href="#n222">No. 222</a>),
taken from a manuscript of the romance of ‚ÄúLancelot,‚Äù of the fourteenth
century, in the National Library in Paris (No. 6956). The host or his
lady sometimes washed the stranger‚Äôs feet themselves. Thus, in the
fabliau quoted above, when the hermit and his companion sought a
lodging at the house of a <i>bourgeois</i>, they were received without question,
and their hosts washed their feet, and then gave them plenty to eat and
drink, and a bed:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Li hoste orent leur piez lavez,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Bien sont peu et abreviez;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Jusqu‚Äô au jor √† ese se jurent.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

We might easily multiply extracts illustrative of this hospitable feeling, as
it existed and was practised from the twelfth century to the fifteenth.
Our cut <a href="#n223">No. 223</a>, taken from a manuscript of the earlier part of the
fourteenth century (MS. Harl. No. 1527), is another representation of
the reception of a stranger in this hospitable manner. In the ‚ÄúRoman
de la Violette‚Äù (p. 233), when its hero, Gerard, sought a lodging at a
castle, he was received with the greatest hospitality; the lord of the castle
led him into the great hall, and there disarmed him, furnished him with
a rich mantle, and caused him to be bathed and washed. In the same
romance (p. 237), when Gerard arrives at the little town of Mouzon, he
goes to the house of a widow to ask for a night‚Äôs lodging, and is received
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
with the same welcome. His horse is taken into a stable, and carefully
attended to, while the lady labours to keep him in conversation until
supper is ready, after which a good bed is made for him, and they all
retire to rest. The comforts, however, which could be offered to the
visitor, consisted often chiefly in eating and drinking. People had few
spare chambers, especially furnished ones, and, in the simplicity of
medi√¶val manners, the guests were obliged to sleep either in the same
room as the family, or, more usually, in the hall, where beds were made
for them on the floor or on the benches. ‚ÄúMaking a bed‚Äù was a phrase
true in its literal sense, and the bed made consisted still of a heap of straw,
with a sheet or two thrown over it. The host, indeed, could often furnish
no more than a room of bare walls and floor as a protection from the
weather, and the guest had to rely as much upon his own resources for
his personal comforts, as if he had had to pass the night in the midst of a
wild wood. Moreover the guests, however numerous and though strangers
to each other, were commonly obliged to sleep together indiscriminately
in the same room.</p>

<p>The old Anglo-Saxon feeling, that the duration of the chance visit of
a stranger should be limited to the third day, seems still to have prevailed.
A Latin rhyme, printed in the ‚ÄúReliqui√¶ Antiqu√¶‚Äù (i. 91), tells us,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Verum dixit anus, quod piscis olet triduanus;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ejus de more simili f√¶tet hospes odore.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In towns the hospitality of the burghers was not always given gratis,
for it was a common custom, even among the richer merchants, to make
a profit by receiving guests. These letters of lodgings were distinguished
from the inn-keepers, or <i>hostelers</i>, by the title of <i>herbergeors</i>, or people
who gave harbour to strangers, and in the larger towns they were submitted
to municipal regulations. The great barons and knights were in
the custom of taking up their lodgings with these herbergeors, rather than
going to the public hostels; and thus a sort of relationship was formed
between particular nobles or kings and particular burghers, on the strength
of which the latter adopted the arms of their habitual lodgers as their
signs. These herbergeors practised great extortions upon their accidental
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
guests, and they appear to have adopted various artifices to allure them to
their houses. These extortions are the subject of a very curious Latin
poem of the thirteenth century, entitled ‚ÄúPeregrinus‚Äù (the Traveller),
the author of which describes the arts employed to allure the traveller,
and the extortions to which he was subjected. It appears that persons were
employed to look out for the arrival of strangers, and that they entered
into conversation with them, pretended to discover that they came from
the same part of the country, and then, as taking especial interest in their
fellow-countrymen, recommended them to lodgings. These tricks of the
burghers who let their lodgings for hire are alluded to in other medi√¶val
writers. It appears, also, that both in these lodging-houses and in the
public inns, it was not an unusual practice to draw people into contracting
heavy bills, which they had not the money to pay, and then to seize their
baggage and even their clothes, to several times the amount of the debt.</p>

of persons in the same bedroom, but also that of sleeping in a state of
perfect nudity. Our next cut (<a href="#n225">No. 225</a>)
is a picture of a medi√¶val tapster; it is
taken from one of the carved seats, or
misereres, in the fine parish church of
Ludlow, in Shropshire. It will, probably,
be remarked that the size of the tapster‚Äôs
jug is rather disproportionate to that of
his barrel; but medi√¶val artists often set
perspective and relative proportions at
defiance.</p>

<p>The tavern in the middle ages seems
to have been the usual scene of a large
portion of the ordinary life of the lower
class of society, and even partially of the middle class, and its influence
was certainly very injurious on the manners and character of the people.
Even the women, as we learn from a number of contemporary songs and
stories, spent much of their time drinking and gossiping in taverns, where
great latitude was afforded for carrying on low intrigues. The tavern
was, in fact, the general rendezvous of those who sought amusement, of
whatever kind. In the ‚ÄúMilleres Tale,‚Äù in Chaucer, Absolon, ‚Äúthat
joly was and gay,‚Äù and who excelled as a musician, frequented the taverns
and ‚Äúbrewhouses,‚Äù meaning apparently the lesser public-houses where
they only sold ale, to exhibit his skill&mdash;

<span class="i0"><i>Ther as that any gaylard tapster was.</i><br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Cant. Tales, l. 3,334.<br /></span>
</span></span>

And Chaucer‚Äôs friar was well acquainted with all the taverns in the towns
he visited&mdash;

The tavern was especially the haunt of gamblers, who were encouraged
by the ‚Äútapster,‚Äù because they brought him his most profitable customers.
As I have said before, when his customers had no money, the taverner
took their articles of dress for payment, and in doing this he added the
profits of the money-lender to those of the taverner. In the fabliau of
‚ÄúGautier d‚ÄôAupais,‚Äù the young prodigal Gautier, hungry and penniless,
arrives towards evening at a tavern, where he finds a number of guests
enjoying themselves. His horse is taken to the stable, and he joins the
guests, but when the moment comes for paying, and the taverner demands
three sols, he is induced in his desperation to try his luck at the dice.
Instead, however, of retrieving his fortunes, he loses his horse and his
robe, and is obliged to return to his father‚Äôs house on foot, and in his
shirt&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Si a perdu sa robe et son corant destrier;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>En pure sa chemise l‚Äôen convint reperier.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The story of Cortois d‚ÄôArras, in the fabliau in ‚ÄúBarbazan‚Äù (i. 355),
is somewhat similar. Young Cortois, also a prodigal, obtains from his
father a large sum of money as a compensation for all his claims on the
paternal property, and with this throws himself upon the world. As he
proceeded, he heard the tavern-boy calling out from the door, ‚ÄúHere is
good wine of Soissons, acceptable to everybody! here credit is given to
everybody, and no pledges taken!‚Äù with much more in the same style.
Cortois determined to stop at the tavern. ‚ÄúHost,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúhow much
do you sell your wine the septier (a measure of two gallons)? and when
was it tapped?‚Äù He was told that it had been fresh tapped that
morning, and that the price was six deniers. The host then goes on to
display his accommodations. ‚ÄúWithin are all sorts of comforts; painted
chambers, and soft beds, raised high with white straw, and made soft
with feathers; here within is hostel for love affairs, and when bed-time
comes you will have pillows of violets to hold your head more softly;
and, finally, you will have electuaries and rose-water, to wash your mouth
and your face.‚Äù Cortois orders a gallon of wine, and immediately afterwards
a <i>belle demoiselle</i> makes her appearance, for such were in these
times reckoned among the attractions of the tavern. It is soon arranged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
between the lady and the landlord that she is to be Cortois‚Äô chamber-companion,
and they all begin drinking together, the taverner persuading
his guest that he owes this choice wine to the lady‚Äôs love. They then go
to carouse in the garden, and they finish by plundering him of his money,
and he is obliged to leave his clothes in pledge for the payment of his
tavern expenses. The ale-wife was especially looked upon as a model of
extortion and deceit, for she cheated unblushingly, both in money and
measure, and she is pointed out in popular literature as an object of hatred
and of satire. Our cut <a href="#n226">No. 226</a>, also furnished by one of the carved
misereres in Ludlow Church, represents a scene from Doomsday: a
demon is bearing away the deceitful ale-wife, who carries nothing with
her but her gay head-dress and her false measure; he is going to throw
her into ‚Äúhell-mouth,‚Äù while another demon is reading her offences
as entered in his roll, and a third is playing on the bagpipes, by way of
welcome.</p>

<span class="small table">EDUCATION.&mdash;LITERARY MEN AND SCRIBES.&mdash;PUNISHMENTS; THE STOCKS;
THE GALLOWS.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">I put</span> together in a short chapter two parts of my subject which may
at the first glance seem somewhat discordant, but which, I think, on
further consideration, will be found to be rather closely related&mdash;they are,
education and punishment for offences against the law. It can hardly be
doubted, indeed, that, as education becomes more general and better
regulated, if the necessity of punishment is not entirely taken away, its
cruelty is greatly diminished.</p>

<p>During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, there was certainly a
general feeling of the necessity of extending and improving education.
It was during this period that our great universities rose into existence,
and flourished, and these schools, which provided for the higher development
of the mind, had their thousands of students, instead of the hundreds
who frequent them at the present day. But the need of some provision
for education was felt most in regard to that less elevated degree of
instruction which was required for the more youthful mind,&mdash;in fact, it
was long before the people of the middle ages could be persuaded that
literary education was of any use at all, except for those who were to be
made great scholars; the clergy itself, unfortunately, did not see the
necessity of popular education, and although the schools in parish churches
were long continued, they appear to have been conducted more and more
with negligence. It was the mercantile class in the towns which made
the first step in advance, by the establishment of those foundations which
have continued to the present time under the name of grammar schools.
These schools are traced back to the thirteenth century, when the merchant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
guilds, by whom they were founded, began to assume a greater
degree of importance, and they were usually intended for the general
benefit of the town, but were combined with an ecclesiastical establishment
for performing services for the souls of the members of the guilds,
in consequence of which, at the Reformation, they became involved in
the superstitious uses, and were dissolved and refounded in the reign
of Edward VI., so that they are now generally known as king Edward‚Äôs
foundations. The great object of these schools was to give the instruction
necessary for admission into the universities; and they were in some
degree the answer to an appeal which came deeply from the mass of the
people,&mdash;for there was at this time a great spontaneous eagerness for
learning, both for the sake of the learning itself, and because it was a
road to high distinction, which was not open to the masses in any other
direction. It was a very common practice for poor youths to go about
the country during vacation time, to beg money to keep them at school
during term. In Piers Ploughman, among the objects of legitimate
charity, the writer enumerates money given to&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>Sette scolers to scole,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or to som othere craftes.</i><br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Piers Ploughman, Vis., l. 4,525.<br /></span>
</span></span>

And in the popular complaints of the burden of taxation, involuntary and
voluntary, the alms given to poor scholars are often enumerated.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n227" src="images/i_n227.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 227. A Monk at his Studies.</i></p></div>

<p>Independent, however, of what may be considered more especially as
scholarship, a considerable amount of instruction began now to be spread
abroad. Reading and writing were becoming much more general
accomplishments, especially among ladies. Among the amusements of
leisure hours, indeed, reading began now to occupy a much larger place
than had been given to it in former ages. Even still, popular literature&mdash;in
the shape of tales, and ballads and songs&mdash;was, in a great measure,
communicated orally. But much had been done during the fourteenth
century towards spreading a taste for literature and knowledge; books
were multiplied, and were extensively read; and wants were already
arising which soon led the way to that most important of modern discoveries,
the art of printing. Most gentlemen had now a few books, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
men of wealth had considerable libraries. The wills of this period,
still preserved, often enumerate the books possessed by the testator, and
show the high value which was set upon them. Many of the illuminations
of the fourteenth century present us with ingenious, and sometimes
fantastic, forms of book-cases and book-stands. In our cut <a href="#n227">No. 227</a>,
from a manuscript of metrical relations of miracles of the Virgin Mary,
now preserved in the library of the city of Soissons in France, we have a
monk reading, seated before a book-stand, the table of which moves up
and down on a screw. Upon this table is the inkstand, and below it
apparently the inkbottle; and the table has in itself receptacles for books
and paper or parchment. In the wall of the room are cupboards, also for
the reception of books, as we see by one lying loose in them. The man
is here seated on a stool; but in our cut <a href="#n228">No. 228</a>, taken from a manuscript
in the National Library in Paris (No. 6985), he is seated in a chair,
with a writing-desk attached to it. The scribe holds in his hand a pen,
with which he is writing, and a knife to scratch the parchment where
anything may need erasion. The table here is also of a curious construction,
and it is covered with books. Other examples are found, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
show that considerable ingenuity was employed in varying the forms of
such library tables.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n228" src="images/i_n228.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 228. A Medi√¶val Writer.</i></p></div>

<p>The next cut (<a href="#n229">No. 229</a>) is taken from one of the illuminations to
a manuscript of the ‚ÄúMoralization of Chess,‚Äù by Jacques de Cessoles (MS.
Reg. 19 C. xi.), and is intended as a sort of figurative representation of
the industrial class of society. It is curious because the figure is made to
carry some of the principal implements of the chief
trades or manufactures, and thus gives us their ordinary
forms. We need only repeat the enumeration of these
from the text. It is, we are told, a man who holds in
his right hand a pair of shears (<i>unes forces</i>); in his left
hand he has a great knife (<i>un grant coustel</i>); ‚Äúand he
must have at his girdle an inkstand (<i>une escriptoire</i>),
and on his ear a pen for writing (<i>et sur l‚Äôoreille une
penne √† escripre</i>).‚Äù Accordingly we see the ink-pot
and the case for writing implements suspended at the
girdle, but by accident the pen does not appear on the
ear in our engraving. It is curious through how great
a length of time the practice of placing the pen behind the ear has continued
in use.

<p>The punishments of the middle ages are remarkable, still more so in
other countries than in England, for a mixture of a small amount of
feeling of strict justice with a very large proportion of the mere feeling
of vengeance. Savage ferocity in the commission of crime led to no less
savage cruelty in retaliation. We have seen, in a former chapter, that
this was not the sentiment of our Anglo-Saxon forefathers, but that their
criminal laws were extremely mild; but after the Norman conquest,
more barbarous feelings on this subject were brought over from the Continent.
Imprisonment itself, even before trial, was made frightfully
cruel; the dungeons into which the accused were thrown were often
filthy holes, sometimes with water running through them, and, as a
refinement in cruelty, loathsome reptiles were bred in them, and the
prisoners were not only allowed insufficient food, but they were sometimes
stripped naked, and thrown into prison in that condition. In the
early English romance of the ‚ÄúSeven Sages‚Äù (the text printed by Weber),
when the emperor was persuaded by his wife to order her step-son for
execution, he commanded that he should be taken, stripped naked of his
clothes, and then hanged aloft&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Quik he het</i> (commanded) <i>his sone take,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And spoili him of clothes nake,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And beten him with scourges stronge,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And afterward him hegge</i> (high) <i>anhonge</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="author">&mdash;Weber, iii. 21.<br /></span>
</span></span>

At the intercession of one of the wise men, the youth is respited and
thrown into prison, but without his clothing; and when, on a subsequent
occasion, he was brought out of prison for judgment, he remained still
naked.</p>

<p>Our three cuts which follow illustrate the subject of medi√¶val punishments
for crimes and offences. The first (<a href="#n230">No. 230</a>) is taken from a well-known
manuscript, in the British Museum, of the fourteenth century
(MS. Reg. 10 E. iv.), and represents a monk and a lady, whose career
has brought them into the stocks, an instrument of punishment which has
figured in some of our former chapters. It is a very old mode of punishing
offenders, and appears, under the Latin name of <i>cippus</i>, in early records
of the middle ages. An old English poem, quoted by Mr. Halliwell in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
his Dictionary, from a manuscript at least as old as the fifteenth century,
recounting the punishments to which some misdoers were condemned,
says:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>And twenty of thes oder ay in a pytt,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In stokkes and feturs for to sytt.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The stocks are frequently referred to in writers of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, and they have not yet become entirely obsolete.
The <i>Leeds Mercury</i> for April 14, 1860, informs us that, ‚ÄúA notorious
character, named John Gambles, of Stanningley (Pudsey), having been
convicted some months ago for Sunday gambling, and sentenced to sit in
the stocks for six hours, left the locality, returned lately, and suffered his
punishment by sitting in the stocks from two till eight o‚Äôclock on Thursday
last.‚Äù They were formerly employed also, in place of fetters, in the
inside of prisons&mdash;no doubt in order to cause suffering by irksome restraint;
and this was so common that the Latin term <i>cippus</i>, and the French <i>ceps</i>,
were commonly used to designate the prison itself. It may be remarked
of these stocks, that they present a peculiarity which we may perhaps call
a primitive character. They are not supported on posts, or fixed in any
way to the spot, but evidently hold the people who are placed in them in
confinement merely by their weight, and by the impossibility of walking
with them on the legs, especially when more persons than one are confined
in them. This is probably the way in which they were used in
prisons.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n231" src="images/i_n231.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 231. An Offender Exposed to Public Shame.</i></p></div>

<p>A material part of the punishment of the stocks, when employed in
the open air, consisted, of course, in the public disgrace to which the
victim was exposed. We might suppose that the shame of such exposure
was keenly felt in the middle ages, from the frequency with which it
was employed. This exposure before the public was, we know, originally,
the chief characteristic of the cucking-stool, for the process of ducking the
victim in the water seems to have been only added to it at a later period.
Our cut <a href="#n231">No. 231</a>, taken from an illumination in the unique manuscript of
the ‚ÄúCent Nouvelles Nouvelles,‚Äù in the Hunterian Library, at Glasgow,
represents a person thus exposed to the scorn and derision of the populace
in the executioner‚Äôs cart, which is drawn through the streets of a town.
To be carried about in a cart was always considered as especially disgraceful,
probably because it was thus that malefactors were usually conducted
to the gallows. In the early romances of the cycle of king
Arthur we have an incident which forms an apt illustration of the prevalence
of this feeling. Sir Lancelot, when hastening to rescue his lady,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
queen Guenever, has the misfortune to lose his horse, and, meeting with
a carter, he seizes his cart as the only means of conveyance, for the
weight of his armour prevented him from walking. Queen Guenever
and her ladies, from a bay window of the castle of sir Meliagraunce, saw
him approach, and one of the latter exclaimed, ‚ÄúSee, madam, where as
rideth in a cart a goodly armed knight! I suppose that he rideth to
hanging.‚Äù Guenever, however, saw by his shield that it was sir Lancelot.
‚Äú‚ÄòAh, most noble knight,‚Äô she said, when she saw him in this condition,
‚ÄòI see well that thou hast been hard bested, when thou ridest in a cart.‚Äô
Then she rebuked that lady that compared him to one riding in a cart to
hanging. ‚ÄòIt was foul mouthed,‚Äô said the queen, ‚Äòand evil compared, so
to compare the most noble knight of the world in such a shameful death.
Oh Jhesu! defend him and keep him,‚Äô said the queen, ‚Äòfrom all mischievous
end.‚Äô‚Äù</p>

<p>Our next cut (<a href="#n232">No. 232</a>) is taken from the same manuscript in the
British Museum which furnished us with <a href="#n230">No. 230</a>. The playful draughtsman
has represented a scene from the world ‚Äúupso-down,‚Äù in which
the rabbits (or perhaps hares) are leading to execution their old enemy
the dog.

<p>The gallows and the wheel were instruments of execution of such
common use in the middle ages that they were continually before people‚Äôs
eyes. Every town, every abbey, and almost every large manorial lord,
had the right of hanging, and a gallows or tree with a man hanging upon
it was so frequent an object in the country that it seems to have been
almost a natural ornament of a landscape, and it is thus introduced by no
means uncommonly in medi√¶val manuscripts. The two examples given
in our cut <a href="#n233">No. 233</a> are taken from the illuminations in the manuscript of

COOKERY OF THE FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURIES.&mdash;BILLS
OF FARE.&mdash;GREAT FEASTS.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">I have</span> spoken of the ceremonious forms of the service of the
medi√¶val table, but we are just now arrived at the period when we
begin to have full information on the composition of the culinary dishes
in which our ancestors indulged, and it will perhaps be well to give a
brief summary of that information as illustrative both of the period we
have now been considering, and of that which follows.</p>

<p>There is a part of the human frame, not very noble in itself, which,
nevertheless, many people are said to worship, and which has even exercised
at times a considerable influence over man‚Äôs destinies. Gastrolatry,
indeed, is a worship which, at one time or other, has prevailed in different
forms over all parts of the world&mdash;its history takes an extensive range, and
is not altogether without interest. One of the first objects of search in a
man who has just risen from savage life to civilization is rather naturally
refinement in his food, and this desire more than keeps pace with the
advance of general refinement, until cookery becomes one of the most
important of social institutions. During all periods of which we read in
history, great public acts, of whatever kind, even to the consecration of a
church, have been accompanied with feasting; and the same rule holds good
throughout all the different phases of our social relations. The materials
for the history of eating are, indeed, abundant, and the field is extensive.</p>

<p>William of Malmesbury, as we have seen before, tells us that the
Anglo-Saxons indulged in great feasting, and lived in very mean houses;
whereas the Normans eat with moderation, but built for themselves
magnificent mansions. Various allusions in old writers leave little room
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
for doubt that our Anglo-Saxon forefathers indulged in much eating;
but, as far as we can gather, for our information is very imperfect, this
indulgence consisted more in the quantity than in the quality of the food,
for their cookery seems to have been in general what we call ‚Äúplain.‚Äù
Refinement in cookery appears to have come in with the Normans; and
from the twelfth century to the sixteenth we can trace the love of the
table continually increasing. The monks, whose institution had, to a
certain degree, separated them from the rest of the world, and who
usually, and from the circumstances perhaps naturally, sought sensual
gratifications, fell soon into the sin of gluttony, and they seem to have led
the way in refinement in the variety and elaborate character of their
dishes. Giraldus Cambrensis, an ecclesiastic himself, complains in very
indignant terms of the luxurious table kept by the monks of Canterbury
in the latter half of the twelfth century; and he relates an anecdote
which shows how far at that time the clergy were, in this respect, in
advance of the laity. One day, when Henry II. paid a visit to Winchester,
the prior and monks of St. Swithin met him, and fell on their
knees before him to complain of the tyranny of their bishop. When the
king asked what was their grievance, they said that their table had been
curtailed of three dishes. The king, somewhat surprised at this complaint,
and imagining, no doubt, that the bishop had not left them
enough to eat, inquired how many dishes he had left them. They
replied, ten; at which the king, in a fit of indignation, told them that
he himself had no more than three dishes to his table, and uttered an
imprecation against the bishop, unless he reduced them to the same
number.</p>

<p>But although we have abundant evidence of the general fact that our
Norman and English forefathers loved the table, we have but imperfect
information on the character of their cookery until the latter half of the
fourteenth century, when the rules and receipts for cooking appear
to have been very generally committed to writing, and a certain
number of cookery-books belonging to this period and to the following
century remain in manuscript, forming very curious records of the domestic
life of our forefathers. From these I will give a few illustrations of this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
subject. These cookery-books sometimes contain plans for dinners of
different descriptions, or, as we should now say, bills of fare, which enable
us, by comparing the names of the dishes with the receipts for making
them, to form a tolerably distinct notion of the manner in which our
forefathers fared at table from four to five hundred years ago. The first
example we shall give is furnished by a manuscript of the beginning of
the fifteenth century, and belongs to the latter part of the century preceding;
that is, to the reign of Richard II., a period remarkable for the
fashion for luxurious living: it gives us the following bill of fare for
the ordinary table of a gentleman, which I will arrange in the form of
a bill of fare of the present day, modernizing the language, except in the
case of obsolete words.</p>

was a favourite article at table, and needs no explanation. The
pottage which follows, under the name of <i>bruce</i>, was made as follows,
according to a receipt in the same cookery-book which has furnished the
bill of fare:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take the umbles of a swine, and parboil them (<i>boil them slowly</i>), and cut them
small, and put them in a pot, with some good broth; then take the whites of
leeks, and slit them, and cut them small, and put them in, with minced onions, and
let it all boil; next take bread steeped in broth, and ‚Äúdraw it up‚Äù with blood and
vinegar, and put it into a pot, with pepper and cloves, and let it boil; and serve all
this together.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span></p>

<p>In the second course, <i>drope</i> is probably an error for <i>drore</i>, a pottage,
which, according to the same cookery-book, was made as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take almonds, and blanch and grind them, and mix them with good meat
broth, and seethe this in a pot; then mince onions, and fry them in fresh ‚Äúgrease,‚Äù
and put them to the almonds; take small birds, and parboil them, and throw them
into the pottage, with cinnamon and cloves and a little ‚Äúfair grease,‚Äù and boil the
whole.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Rose</i> was made as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take powdered rice, and boil it in almond-milk till it be thick, and take the
brawn of capons and hens, beat it in a mortar, and mix it with the preceding, and
put the whole into a pot, with powdered cinnamon and cloves, and whole mace,
and colour it with saunders (<i>sandal-wood</i>).</p></blockquote>

<p>It may be necessary to explain that almond-milk consisted simply of
almonds ground and mixed with milk or broth. The <i>farsure</i>, or stuffing,
for chickens was made thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take fresh pork, seethe it, chop it small, and grind it well; put to it hard
yolks of eggs, well mixed together, with dried currants, powder of cinnamon and
maces, cubebs, and cloves whole, and roast it.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am unable to explain the meaning of <i>malachis</i>, the dish which
concludes this course.</p>

<p>The first dish in the third course, coneys, or rabbits, in gravy, was
made as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take rabbits, and parboil them, and chop them in ‚Äúgobbets,‚Äù and seethe them
in a pot with good broth; then grind almonds, ‚Äúdress them up‚Äù with beef broth,
and boil this in a pot; and, after passing it through a strainer, put it to the rabbits,
adding to the whole cloves, maces, pines (<i>the kernels of the pine cone</i>), and sugar; colour
it with sandal-wood, saffron, bastard or other wine, and cinnamon powder mixed
together, and add a little vinegar.</p></blockquote>

<p>Not less complicated was the boar in <i>bras√©</i>, or <i>brasey</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take the ribs of a boar, while they are fresh, and parboil them till they are
half boiled; then roast them, and, when they are roasted, chop them, and put
them in a pot with good fresh beef broth and wine, and add cloves, maces, pines,
currants, and powdered pepper; then put chopped onions in a pan, with fresh
grease, fry them first and then boil them; next, take bread, steeped in broth,
‚Äúdraw it up‚Äù and put it to the onions, and colour it with sandal-wood and saffron,
and as it settles, put a little vinegar mixed with powdered cinnamon to it; then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
take brawn, and cut it into slices two inches long, and throw it into the pot with
the foregoing, and serve it all up together.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Raffyolys</i> were a sort of patties, made as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take swine‚Äôs flesh, seethe it, chop it small, add to it yolks of eggs, and mix
them well together; put to this a little minced lard, grated cheese, powdered
ginger, and cinnamon; make of this balls of the size of an apple, and wrap them
up in the cawl of the swine, each ball by itself; make a raised crust of dough,
and put the ball in it, and bake it; when they are baked, take yolks of eggs well
beaten, with sugar and pepper, coloured with saffron, and pour this mixture over
them.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Flampoyntes</i> were made thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take good ‚Äúinterlarded‚Äù pork, seethe it, and chop it, and grind it small; put
to it good fat cheese grated, and sugar and pepper; put this in raised paste like the
preceding; then make a thin leaf of dough, out of which cut small ‚Äúpoints,‚Äù fry
these in grease, and then stick them in the foregoing mixture after it has been put
in the crust, and bake it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was a tolerably respectable dinner at the end of the fourteenth
century; but the same treatise gives us the following bill of fare, for a
larger dinner, though still arranged in three courses:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span></p>

<p>The receipt for making <i>farsed browet</i>, or <i>browet farsyn</i>, is literally as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take almonds and pound them, and mix with beef broth, so as to make it
thick, and put it in a pot with cloves, maces, and figs, currants, and minced
ginger, and let all this seethe; take bread, and steep it in sweet wine, and ‚Äúdraw
it up,‚Äù and put it to the almonds with sugar; then take <i>conyngs</i> (rabbits), or
rabbettes (<i>young rabbits</i>), or squirrels, and first parboil and then fry them, and
partridges parboiled; fry them whole for a lord, but otherwise chop them into
gobbets; and when they are almost fried, cast them in a pot, and let them boil
altogether, and colour with sandal-wood and saffron; then add vinegar and
powdered cinnamon strained with wine, and give it a boil; then take it from the
fire, and see that the pottage is thin, and throw in a good quantity of powdered
ginger.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is repeated, at the end of this receipt, that, for a lord, a coney,
rabbit, squirrel, or partridge, should be served whole in this manner.
The other pottage in this course, <i>charlet</i>, was less complex, and was
made thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take sweet cow‚Äôs milk, put it in a pan, throw into it the yolks and white of
eggs, and boiled pork, pounded, and sage; let it boil till it curds, and colour it
with saffron.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following was the syrup for a capon:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take almonds, and pound them, and mix them with wine, till they make a
thick ‚Äúmilk,‚Äù and colour it with saffron, and put it in a saucepan, and put into it
a good quantity of figs and currants, and add ground ginger, cloves, galingale
(<i>a spice much used in the middle ages</i>), and cinnamon; let all this boil; add sugar, and
pour it over your capon or pheasant.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>leche</i> in this first course was, perhaps, the dish which is called in
the receipts a <i>leche lumbarde</i>, which was made thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take raw pork, and pull off the skin, and pick out the skin sinews, and pound
the pork in a mortar with raw eggs; add to it sugar, salt, raisins, currants,
minced dates, powdered pepper, and cloves; put it in a bladder, and let it seethe
till it be done enough, and then cut it into slips of the form of peas-cods: grind
raisins in a mortar, mix them with red wine, and put to them almond-milk,
coloured with sandal-wood and saffron, and add pepper and cloves, and then boil
the whole; when it is boiled, mix cinnamon and ginger with wine and pour on it,
and so serve it.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Browet of Almayne</i>, which comes in with the second course of this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
dinner, was a rather celebrated pottage. It was made in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take coneys, and parboil them, and chop them in gobbets, and put them
with ribs of pork or kid into a pot, and seethe it; then take ground almonds, and
mix them with beef broth, and put this in a pot with cloves, maces, pines, minced
ginger, and currants, and with onions, and boil it, and colour it with saffron, and
when this is boiled, take the flesh out from the broth, and put it in it; and take
‚Äúalkanet‚Äù (<i>alkanet is explained in the dictionaries as the name of a plant, wild buglos; it
appears to have been used in cookery to give colour</i>), and fry it, and press it into the
pot through a strainer, and finally add a little vinegar and ground ginger mixed
together.</p></blockquote>

<p>The composition of <i>viande royale</i> was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take Greek wine, or Rhenish wine, and clarified honey, and mix them well
with ground rice, ginger, pepper, cinnamon, and cloves, saffron, sugar, mulberries,
and sandal-wood; boil the mixture, and salt it, and take care that it be thick.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pome de oringe</i> was quite a different thing to what we should expect
from the name. It was made as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take pork liver, pound it well raw, and put to it ground pepper, cloves, cinnamon,
saffron, and currants; make of this balls like apples, and wet them well in
the white of eggs, and then put them in boiling water, and let them seethe, and
when they have seethed a while, take them out, and put them on a spit, and roast
them well; then take parsley, and grind it, and wring it up with eggs through a
strainer, and put a little flour to it, and with this ‚Äúendore‚Äù the balls while roasting,
and, if you will, you may take saffron, sandal-wood, or indigo, to colour them.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Endore</i> was the technical term of the kitchen for washing over an
article of cookery with yolks of eggs, or any other liquid, to give a shiny
appearance to its exterior when cooked.</p>

<p>Both the pottages in the third course are rather elaborate ones. The
following was the process of making boar in <i>egurdouce</i>, or <i>egredouce</i>, a
word which of course means ‚Äúsour-sweet:‚Äù&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take dates, washed clean, and currants, and boil them, and pound them
together, and in pounding put cloves to them, and mix them up with vinegar, or
clarey, or other sweet wine, and put it in a fair pot, and boil it well; and then put
to it half a quartern of sugar, or else honey, and half an ounce of cinnamon in
powder, and in the ‚Äúsetting down‚Äù take a little vinegar and mix with it, and half
an ounce of ground ginger, and a little sandal-wood and saffron; and in the
boiling put minced ginger to it; next, take fresh brawn, and seethe it, and then cut
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
it in thin slices, and lay three in a dish, and then take half a pound of pines, and
fry them in fresh grease, and throw the pines into it; and when they are thoroughly
hot take them out with a skimmer, and let them dry, and cast them into the same
pot; and then put the syrup above the brawn in the dishes, and serve it.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mawmen√©</i> was made according to the following receipt:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take almonds and blanch them and pound them, and mix them with water
or wine, and take the brawn of capons or pheasants, and pound it small, and mix
it with the other, and add ground rice, and put it in a pot and let it boil; and
add powder of ginger and cloves, and cinnamon and sugar; and take rice, and
parboil it and grind it, and add it to them, and colour it with sandal-wood,
and pour it out in dishes; and take the grains of pomegranates and stick in it, or
almonds or pines fried in grease, and strew sugar over it.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following was the manner of making the <i>crustade</i>, mentioned in
the third course of this bill of fare:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take chickens, and pigeons, and small birds, and make them clean, and chop
them to pieces, and stew them altogether in a good broth made of fair grease
and ground pepper and cloves, and add verjus to it, and colour it with saffron;
then make raised crusts, and pinch them and lay the flesh therein, and put to it
currants, and ground ginger, and cinnamon; and take raw eggs, and break them,
and strain them through a strainer into the pottage of the stew, and stir it well
together, and pour it into the raised crusts, above the flesh, and then place the
covers on them and serve them.</p></blockquote>

<p>The process of serving a peacock ‚Äúwith the skin‚Äù also requires some
explanation. The skin was first stripped off, with the feathers, tail, and
neck and head, and it was spread on a table and strewed with ground
cummin; then the peacock was taken and roasted, and ‚Äúendored‚Äù with
raw yolks of eggs; and when roasted, and after it had been allowed to
cool a little, it was sewn into the skin, and thus served on the table,
always with the last course, when it looked as though the bird were alive.
To make <i>cokagrys</i>, you must</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take an old cock and pull him, and wash him, and skin him all but the legs,
and fill him full of the stuffing made for the pome de oringe; and also take a
pig and skin him from the middle downwards, and fill him full of the same stuffing,
and sew them fast together, and seethe them; and when they have seethed a
good while, take them up and put them on a spit, and roast them well, and endore
them with yolks of eggs mixed with saffron; and when they are roasted, before
placing them on the table, lay gold and silver foil on them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Flampoyntes have been already explained. Pears in syrup were
merely boiled in wine, and seasoned with sugar and spices.</p>

<p>In these bills of fare, our readers who believe in the prevalence of
‚Äúold English roast beef,‚Äù will find that belief singularly dissipated, for our
ancestors seem to have indulged in all sorts of elaborately made dishes, in
which immense quantities of spices were employed. The number of
receipts in these early cookery-books is wonderfully great, and it is evident
that people sought variety almost above all other things. Among the
Sloane manuscripts in the library of the British Museum, there is a very
complete cookery-book (MS. No. 1201) belonging to the latter part of the
fifteenth century, which gives seven bills of fare of seven dinners, each to
differ entirely in the dishes composing it from the other, with the object,
of course, of giving a different dinner every day during seven consecutive
days. In the foregoing bills of fare, we have seen that on flesh-days no
fish was introduced on the table, but fish is introduced along with flesh in
the seven dinners just alluded to, which are, moreover, curious for the
number of articles, chiefly birds, introduced in them, which we are not
now accustomed to eat. The first of these bills of fare, which are all
limited to two courses, runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i25"><i>First Course, of Eleven Dishes.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nowmbles (<i>umbles</i>) of an harte. Vyand ryalle. The syde of an hert rostede.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Swanne with chauderoun. Fesaunt rostede. Bytore (<i>bittern</i>) rostede.<br /></span>
<span class="i21">Pyke, and grete gurnarde.<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Haggesse of Almayne. Blaunche custade.<br /></span>
<span class="i11">A sotelt√©, a blake bore enarmede with golde.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i25"><i>Second Course, of Eleven Dishes.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i32">Gel√©. Cream of almonds.<br /></span>
<span class="i7">Kynd kydde. Fillets of an herte endored. Squyrelle rost.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Chykons (<i>chickens</i>) ylarded. Partriche and lark rost.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">Perche and porpoys rost.<br /></span>
<span class="i13">Frytours Lumbard. Payne puffe (<i>puff-bread</i>).<br /></span>
<span class="i6">A sotelt√©, a castelle of sylver with fanes (<i>vanes or flags</i>) of gold.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It appears that at this time it was considered more absolutely necessary
than at an earlier period, that each course at table should be accompanied
with a subtilty, or ornamental device in pastry, representing groups of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
various descriptions, as here a black boar and a castle. We have here the
porpoise eaten among fishes, and the squirrel among animals; we have
before seen hedgehogs served at table. In the ‚ÄúM√©nagier de Paris,‚Äù a
French compilation, made in the year 1393, a hedgehog is directed to
have its throat cut, and to be skinned and emptied, and then to be
arranged as a chicken, and pressed and well dried in a towel; after this
it was to be roasted and eaten with ‚Äúcameline,‚Äù a word the exact meaning
of which seems not to be known; or in pastry, with duckling sauce.
Squirrels were to be treated as rabbits. The same book gives directions
for cooking magpies, rooks, and jackdaws. The second of the seven bills
of fare given in the Sloane Manuscript contains turtles (the bird) and
throstles, roasted; in the third we have roasted egrets (a species of heron),
starlings, and linnets; in the fourth, ‚Äúmartinettes;‚Äù in the fifth, barnacles,
‚Äúmolette,‚Äù sparrows, and, among fishes, minnows; and in the sixth,
roasted cormorants, heathcocks, sheldrakes, dotterels, and thrushes. The
seventh bill of fare runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>First Course, of Nine Dishes.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<p>The bills of fare I have thus given are intended for dinners of moderate
size, but I might easily have given much larger ones, though we
should have learnt nothing more by them than by the smaller ones, from
which the reader will be able to form a very good judgment of the
general style of eating among our forefathers, when they lived well. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
fifteenth century, especially, was celebrated for its great feasts, at which
the consumption of provisions was enormous. The bills of expenses of some
of them have been preserved. In the sixth year of the reign of Edward IV.
(<small>A.D.</small> 1466), George Nevile was made archbishop of York, and the account
of the expenditure for the feast on that occasion contains the following
articles:&mdash;Three hundred quarters of wheat, three hundred tuns of ale, one
hundred tuns of wine, one pint of hypocras, a hundred and four oxen,
six wild bulls, a thousand sheep, three hundred and four calves, the same
number of swine, four hundred swans, two thousand geese, a thousand
capons, two thousand pigs, four hundred plovers, a hundred dozen of quails,
two hundred dozen of the birds called ‚Äúrees,‚Äù a hundred and four peacocks,
four thousand mallards and teals, two hundred and four cranes, two
hundred and four kids, two thousand chickens, four thousand pigeons,
four thousand crays, two hundred and four bitterns, four hundred herons,
two hundred pheasants, five hundred partridges, four hundred woodcocks,
one hundred curlews, a thousand egrettes, more than five hundred stags,
bucks, and roes, four thousand cold venison pasties, a thousand ‚Äúparted‚Äù
dishes of jelly, three thousand plain dishes of jelly, four thousand cold
baked tarts, fifteen hundred hot venison pasties, two thousand hot custards,
six hundred and eight pikes and breams, twelve porpoises and seals, with
a proportionate quantity of spices, sugared delicacies, and wafers or
cakes.</p>

<p>On the inthronation of William Warham as archbishop of Canterbury
in 1504, the twentieth year of the reign of Henry VII., a feast was given
for which the following provisions were purchased:&mdash;Fifty-four quarters
of wheat, twenty shillings‚Äô worth of fine flour for making wafers, six tuns
or pipes of red wine, four of claret wine, one of choice white wine, and
one of white wine for the kitchen, one butt of malmsey, one pipe of
wine of Osey, two tierces of Rhenish wine, four tuns of London ale, six
of Kentish ale, and twenty of English beer, thirty-three pounds‚Äô worth of
spices, three hundred lings, six hundred codfish, seven barrels of salted
salmon, forty fresh salmon, fourteen barrels of white herrings, twenty
cades of red herrings (each cade containing six hundred herrings, which
would make a total of twelve thousand), five barrels of salted sturgeons,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
two barrels of salted eels, six hundred fresh eels, eight thousand whelks,
five hundred pikes, four hundred tenches, a hundred carps, eight hundred
breams, two barrels of salted lampreys, eighty fresh lampreys, fourteen
hundred fresh lamperns, a hundred and twenty-four salted congers, two
hundred great roaches, a quantity of seals and porpoises, with a considerable
quantity of other fish. It will be understood at once that this feast
took place on a fish day.</p>

<p>This habit of profuse and luxurious living seems to have gradually
declined during the sixteenth and first part of the seventeenth century,
until it was extinguished in the great convulsion which produced the
interregnum. After the Restoration, we find that the table, among all
classes, was furnished more soberly, and with plainer and more substantial
dishes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span></p>

OF THE HOUSES.&mdash;THE HALL AND ITS FURNITURE.&mdash;ARRANGEMENT
OF THE TABLE FOR MEALS.&mdash;ABSENCE OF CLEANLINESS.&mdash;MANNERS
AT TABLE.&mdash;THE PARLOUR.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> progress of society in the two countries which were most closely
allied in this respect, England and France, was slow during the
fifteenth century. Both countries were engaged either in mutual hostility
or in desolating civil wars, which so utterly checked all spirit of
improvement, that the aspect of society differed little between the beginning
and the end of the century in anything but dress. At the close of
the fourteenth century, the middle classes in England had made great
advance in wealth and in independence, and the wars of the roses, which
were so destructive to the nobility, as well as the tendency of the crown
to set the gentry up as a balance to the power of the feudal barons,
helped to make that advance more certain and rapid. This increase of
wealth appears in the multiplication of furniture and of other household
implements, especially those of a more valuable description. We are
surprised, in running our eye through the wills and inventories during
this period, at the quantity of plate which was usually possessed by country
gentlemen and respectable burghers. There was also a great increase
both in the number and magnitude of the houses which intervened
between the castle and the cottage. Instead of having one or two bedrooms,
and turning people into the hall to sleep at night, we now find
whole suits of chambers; while, where before, the family lived chiefly in
the hall, privacy was sought by the addition of parlours, of which there
were often more than one in an ordinary sized house. The hall was in fact
already beginning to diminish in importance in comparison with the rest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
of the house. Whether in town or country, houses of any magnitude
were now generally built round an interior court, into which the rooms
almost invariably looked, only small and unimportant windows looking
towards the street or country. This arrangement of course originated in
the necessity of studying security, a necessity which was never felt more
than in the fifteenth century. We have less need to seek our illustrations
from manuscripts during this period, on account of the numerous examples
of buildings which still remain in a greater or less state of perfection, but
still an illumination now and then presents us with an interesting picture
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
of the architectural arrangements of a dwelling-house in the fifteenth
century, which may be advantageously compared with the buildings that
still exist. One of these is represented in our cut <a href="#n234">No. 234</a>, taken from an
illuminated copy of the French translation of Valerius Maximus (MS.
No. 6984, in the National Library at Paris). The building to the left is
probably the staircase turret of the gateway; that before us is the mass of
the household apartments. We are supposed to be standing within the
court. At the foot of the turret is the well, a very important object
within the court, where it was always placed in houses of this description,
as in the troubles of those days the household might be obliged to shut
themselves up for a day or two and depend for their supply of water
entirely on what they could get within their walls.</p>

<p>The cut here given (<a href="#n234">No. 234</a>) is a remarkably good and perfect representation
of the exterior, looking towards the court, of the domestic
buildings. The door on the ground floor to the right is probably, to judge
by the position of the windows, the entrance to the hall. The steps
leading to the first floor are outside the wall, an arrangement which is not
uncommon in the existing examples of houses of this period in England.
We have also here the open gallery round
the chambers on the first floor, which is
so frequently met with in our houses of
the fifteenth century. It is probable that
within the door at the top of the external
flight of steps, as here represented, a
short staircase led up to the floor on which
the chambers were situated. Perhaps it
may have been a staircase into the gallery,
as the opening round the corner
to the right seems to be a door from
the gallery into the chambers.</p>

<div class="figright"><img id="n235" src="images/i_n235.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 235. A Knight at the Door.</i></p></div>

<p>In another illumination in the same
manuscript (cut <a href="#n235">No. 235</a>), a knight is
represented knocking at the door of a
house into which he seeks admittance. The plain knocker and the ring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
will be recognised at once by all who have been accustomed to examine
the original doors still remaining in so many of our old buildings, but why
the person who thus signifies his wish to enter should hold the ring with
his right hand, and the knocker with his left, is not very clear. The
knocker, instead of being plain, as in this cut, was often very ornamental.
This is, of course, the outer door of the house, and our readers will not
overlook the loophole and the small window through which the person
who knocked might be examined, and, if necessary, interrogated, before
the door was opened to him.</p>

<p>Let us now pass through the door on the ground floor, always open
by day, into the hall. This was still the most spacious apartment in the
house, and it was still also the public room, open to all who were admitted
within the precincts. The hall continued to be scantily furnished. The
permanent furniture consisted chiefly in benches, and in a seat with a
back to it for the superior members of the family. The head table at
least was now generally a permanent one, and there were in general more
permanent tables, or tables dormant, than formerly, but still the greater
part of the tables in the hall were made for each meal by placing boards
upon trestles. Cushions, with ornamental cloths, called <i>bankers</i> and
<i>dorsers</i>, for placing over the benches and backs of the seats of the better
persons at the table, were now also in general use. Tapestry was suspended
on the walls of the hall on special occasions, but it does not
appear to have been of common use. Another article of furniture had
now become common&mdash;the buffet, or stand on which the plate and other
vessels were arranged. These articles appear to have been generally in
the keeping of the butler, and only to have been brought into the hall
and arranged on the buffet at meal times, for show as much as for use.
The dinner party in our cut <a href="#n236">No. 236</a>, taken from an illumination of a
manuscript of the romance of the ‚ÄúComte d‚ÄôArtois,‚Äù formerly in the
possession of M. Barrois, a distinguished and well-known collector in Paris,
represents a royal party dining at a table with much simplicity. The
ornamental vessel on the table is probably the salt-cellar, which was a
very important article at the feast. Besides the general utility of salt, it
was regarded with profoundly superstitious feelings, and it was considered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
desirable that it should be the first article placed on the table. We have
still a feeling of superstition with regard to the spilling of salt. A metrical
code for the behaviour of servants, written in the fifteenth century, directs
that in preparing the table for meals, the table-cloth was first to be spread,
and then, invariably and in all places, the salt was to be placed upon it;
next were to be arranged successively, the knives, the bread, the wine,
and then the meat, after which the waiter was to bring other things,
when each was called for:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Tu dois mettre premierement</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>En tous lieux et en tout hostel</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>La nappe, et apres le sel;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Cousteaulx, pain, vin, et puis viande,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Puis apporter ce qu‚Äôon demande.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

In our last cut (<a href="#n236">No. 236</a>) it will be seen that the ‚Äúnappe‚Äù is duly laid,
and upon it are seen the salt-cellar, the bread (round cakes), and the cups
for wine. Knives are wanting, and the plates seldom appear on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
table in these dinner scenes of the fifteenth century, any more than in
the previous period. This, no doubt, arose from the common practice at
that time, of people carrying their own knives with them in a sheath
attached to the girdle. We find, moreover, few knives enumerated in
our inventories of household goods and chattels. In the English metrical
‚ÄúStans Puer ad Mensam,‚Äù or rules for behaviour at table, written by
Lydgate, the guest is told to ‚Äúbring no knyves unskoured to the table,‚Äù
which can only mean that he is to keep his own knife that he carries
with him clean. The two servants are here duly equipped for duty, with
the towel thrown over the shoulder. The table appears to be placed on
two board-shaped trestles, but the artist has forgotten to indicate the seats.
But in our next cut (<a href="#n237">No. 237</a>), a very private party, taken from a manuscript
of the early French translation of the Decameron (in the National
Library at Paris, No. 6887), are placed in a seat with a back to it,
although the table is still evidently a board placed upon trestles. It may
be remarked that in dinner scenes of this century, the gentlemen at table
are almost always represented with their hats on their heads.</p>

<p>As we have already hinted, the inventories of this period give us
curious information on the furniture of houses of different descriptions.
We learn from one of these, made in 1446, that there were at that time
belonging to the hall of the priory of Durham, one dorsal or dorser,
embroidered with the birds of St. Cuthbert and the arms of the church,
five pieces of red cloth (three embroidered and two plain), no doubt for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
the same purpose of throwing over the seats; six cushions; three basins
of brass; and three washing-basins. A gentleman at Northallerton, in
Yorkshire, who made his will in 1444, had in his hall, thirteen jugs or
pots of brass, four basins, and two ewers (of course, for washing the
hands), three candlesticks, five (metal) dishes, three kettles, nine vessels
of lead and pewter, ‚Äúutensils of iron belonging to the hall,‚Äù valued at
two shillings&mdash;probably the fire-irons, one dorser and one banker. An
inventory of a gentleman‚Äôs goods in the year 1463, apparently in the
southern part of England (printed in the ‚ÄúNew Retrospective Review‚Äù),
gives, as the contents of the hall,&mdash;a standing spear, a hanging of stained
work, a mappa-mundi (a map of the world) of parchment&mdash;a curious
article for the hall, a side-table, one ‚Äúdormond‚Äù table (a permanent
table), a beam with six candlesticks.</p>

<p>A vocabulary of the fifteenth century (‚ÄúVolume of Vocabularies,‚Äù
p. 197) enumerates, as the ordinary furniture of the hall, a board, a
trestle, a banker, a dorser, a natte (table-cloth), a table dormant, a basin,
a laver, fire on a hearth, a brand or torch, a yule-block, an andiron, tongs,
a pair of bellows, wood for the fire, a long settle, a chair, a bench, a
stool, a cushion, and a screen. The permanent or dormant table, is shown
in the scene given in our cut <a href="#n238">No. 238</a>, taken from the beautifully illuminated
manuscript of the ‚ÄúRoman de la Violette,‚Äù at Paris, some facsimiles
from which were privately distributed by the comte de Bastard,
from whom I had the honour of receiving a copy. We have here also
the seat with its back, and the buffet with its jugs and dishes. In
our cut <a href="#n236">No. 236</a>, we had the waits or trumpeters, who were always
attached to the halls of great people to announce the commencement of
the dinner. Only persons of a certain rank were allowed this piece of
ostentation; but everybody had minstrelsy to dinner who could obtain it,
and when it was at hand. The wandering minstrel was welcome in every
hall, and for this very reason the class of ambulatory musicians was very
numerous. In the scene given in this cut (<a href="#n238">No. 238</a>), the wandering
minstrel, or, according to the story, a nobleman in that disguise, has just
arrived, and he is allowed, without ceremony or suspicion, to seat himself
at the fire, apparently on a stool, beside the two individuals at dinner.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n238" src="images/i_n238.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 238. Reception of the Minstrel.</i></p></div>

<p>The floor of the hall was usually paved with tiles, or with flag stones,
and very little care appears to have been shown to cleanliness, as far as it
was concerned, except that it was usual to strew it with rushes. Among
the various French metrical ‚ÄúContenances de Table,‚Äù or directions for
behaviour at table, of the fifteenth century, the person instructed is told
that he must not <i>spit upon the table</i> at dinner time&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ne craiche par dessus la table,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Car c‚Äôest chose desconvenable</i>,<br /></span>
</span></span>

which is necessarily an intimation that he must spit upon the floor. In
another of these pieces he is told that when he washes his mouth at table,
he must not reject the water into the basin&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Quant ta bouche tu laveras,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ou bacin point ne cracheras.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The reason for this rule was evidently the circumstance that one basin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
might serve for all the company; but the alternative again was of course
to spit the water out upon the floor. Again, in one of these codes, the
learner is told that when he makes sops in his wine, he must either drink
all the wine in the glass, or throw what remains on the floor:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Enfant, se tu faiz en ton verre</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Souppes de vin aucunement,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Boy tout le vin entierement,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ou autrement le gecte √† terre.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

Or, as it is expressed in another similar code more briefly&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Se tu fais souppes en ton verre,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Boy le vin ou le gette √† terre.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

There can be no doubt that all this must have made an extremely dirty
floor. Another rather <i>na√Øve</i> direction shows that no more attention was
paid to the cleanliness of the benches and seats; it is considered necessary
to tell the scholar always to look at his seat before he sits down at table,
to a assure himself that there is nothing dirty upon it!&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Enfant, prens de regarder peine</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sur le siege o√π tu te sierras,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Se aucune chose y verras</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Qui soit deshonneste ou vilaine.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The fireplace at the side of the hall, with hearth and chimney, were
now in general use. An example is given in our last cut; another will
be seen in our cut <a href="#n239">No. 239</a>, and here, though evidently in the hall, and
a monastic hall too, the process of cooking is pursued at it. The monks
appear to be taking a joyous repast, not quite in keeping with the strict
rule of their order, and the way in which they are conducting themselves
towards the women who have been introduced into the monastery does
not speak in favour of monastic continence. This picture is from a
manuscript bible, of the fifteenth century, in the National Library at
Paris (No. 6829).</p>

<p>Manners at table appear to have been losing some of the strictness and
stiffness of their ceremonial, while they retained their rudeness. The
bowl of water was carried round to the guests, and each washed his hands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
before dinner, but the washing after dinner appears now to have been
commonly omitted. In one of the directions for table already quoted,
the scholar is told that he must wash himself when he rises from bed in
the morning, once at dinner, and once at supper, in all thrice a day:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Enfant, d‚Äôhonneur lave tes mains</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A ton lever, √† ton disner,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Et puis au soupper, sans finer;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ce sont trois foys √† tout le moins.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

And again, in another similar code,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Lave tes mains devant disner,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Et aussi quant vouldras soupper.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n239" src="images/i_n239.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 239. A Monastic Feast.</i></p></div>

<p>Still people put their victuals to their mouth with their fingers, for,
though forks were certainly known in the previous century, they were
not used for conveying the food to the mouth. It was considered, nevertheless,
bad manners to carry the victuals to the mouth with the knife&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ne faiz pas ton morsel conduire</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A ton coustel qui te peult nuire.</i><br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
</div></div>

<p>Another practice strictly forbidden in these rules was picking your
teeth with your knife while at table. From the use thus made of the
hand, in the absence of forks, it may be supposed that we should have
directions for keeping it clean during the process of eating. One of these
appears droll enough to us at the present day. It is directed that a
person sitting at table in company is not to blow his nose with the hand
with which he takes his meat. Handkerchiefs were not yet in use, and
the alternative of course was that, if any one felt the need of performing
the operation in question, he was to lay down his knife, and to do it
with the hand which held it. In one of the French codes this direction
is given rather covertly, as follows:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ne touche ton nez √† main nue</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dont ta viande est tenue.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

But in another it is enunciated more crudely, thus:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Enfant, se ton nez est morveux,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ne le torche de la main nue</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>De quoy ta viande est tenue;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Le fait est vilain et honteux.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

All these circumstances show a state of manners which was very far from
refined.</p>

<p>Among other directions for table, you are told not to leave your spoon
in your platter; not to return back to your plate the food you have put
in your mouth; not to dip your meat in the salt-cellar to salt it, but to
take a little salt on your knife and put it on the meat; not to drink from
a cup with a dirty mouth; not to offer to another person the remains of
your pottage; not to eat much cheese; to take only two or three nuts,
when they are placed before you; not to play with your knife; not to
roll your napkin into a cord, or tie it in knots; and not to get intoxicated
during dinner-time!</p>

<p>Our next cut (<a href="#n240">No. 240</a>) represents one of the backed seats, after a
pattern of this century. It is taken from a manuscript of the romance
of Launcelot du Lac, in the National Library at Paris (No. 594). It is
probable that this seat belonged to the parlour, or, as the name signifies,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
conversation room. The custom still continued of making seats with
divisions, so that each person sat in a separate compartment. A triple
seat of this kind is represented in our cut <a href="#n241">No. 241</a>, taken from a manuscript
of the French Boccaccio in the National Library at Paris.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n240" src="images/i_n240.jpg" alt="" />

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n241" src="images/i_n241.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 241. A Triple Seat.</i></p></div>

<p>The parlour seems to have been ornamented with more care, and to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
have been better furnished than the hall. This apartment appears to
have been placed sometimes on the ground floor, and sometimes on the
floor above, and large houses had usually two or three parlours. It had
often windows in recesses, with fixed seats on each side; and the fireplace
was smaller and more comfortable than that of the hall. As carpets
came into more general use, the parlour was one of the first rooms to
receive this luxury. In the inventory I have already quoted from the
‚ÄúNew Retrospective Review,‚Äù the following articles of furniture are
described as being in the parlour&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>A hanging of worsted, red and green.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A cupboard of ash-boards.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A table, and a pair of trestles.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A branch of latten, with four lights.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A pair of andirons.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A pair of tongs.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A form to sit upon.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And a chair.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

This will give us a very good idea of what was the usual furniture of the
parlour in the fifteenth century. The only movable seats are a single
bench, and one chair&mdash;perhaps a seat with a back like that shown above.
The table was even here formed by laying a board upon trestles. The
cupboard was peculiar to this part of the house; many of my readers will
probably remember the parlour cupboards in our old country houses, the
branched candlestick of metal, suspended from the ceiling, and the tongs
and andirons for the fire.</p>

<p>The principal articles of furniture in the parlour are all exhibited in
illuminations in manuscripts of the same period. The ‚Äúhanging of
worsted‚Äù was, of course, a piece of tapestry for the wall, or for some part
of the wall, for the room was in many, perhaps in most, cases, only
partially covered. Sometimes, indeed, it appears only to have been hung
up on occasions, perhaps for company, when it seems to have been placed
behind the chief seat.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> The wall itself was frequently adorned with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
paintings, in common houses rude and merely ornamental, while in others
of a better class they represented histories, scenes from romances, and
religious subjects, much like those exhibited on the tapestries themselves.
In the cut annexed (<a href="#n242">No. 242</a>), taken from a beautifully illuminated
manuscript of the romance of ‚ÄúLancelot,‚Äù in the National Library at
Paris, No. 6784, we have a representation of a parlour with wall paintings
of this kind. Morgan le Fay is showing king Arthur the adventures of
Lancelot, which she had caused to be painted in a room in her palace.
Paintings of this kind are very often alluded to in the old writers, especially
in the poets, as every one knows who has read the ‚ÄúRomance of
the Rose,‚Äù the works of Chaucer, or that singular and curious poem, the
‚ÄúPastyme of Pleasure,‚Äù by Stephen Hawes. Chaucer, in his ‚ÄúDream,‚Äù
speaks of&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14"><i>A chamber paint</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Full of stories old and divers,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>More than I can as now reherse.</i><br /></span>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 242. Morgan le Fay showing king Arthur the Paintings of the Adventures of Lancelot.</i></p></div>

<p>There was in the castle of Dover an apartment called Arthur‚Äôs Hall,
and another named Guenevra‚Äôs Chamber, which have been supposed to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
so called from the subjects of the paintings with which they were decorated;
and a still more curious illustration of the foregoing drawing is furnished
by an old house of this period still existing in New Street, Salisbury,
a room in which preserves its painting in distemper, occupying the upper
part of the wall, like the story of Lancelot in the pictures of the room of
Morgan le Fay. We give a sketch of the side of this room occupied by
the painting in the accompanying cut (<a href="#n243">No. 243</a>). It occupies the space
above the fireplace, and the windows looking into the street, but it has
been much damaged by modern alterations in the house. The subject,
as will at once be seen, was of a sacred character&mdash;the offering of the
three kings.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n243" src="images/i_n243.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 243. Wall-Paintings still remaining in a House at Salisbury.</i></p></div>

<p>The window to the left of the fireplace, which is one of the original
windows of this house, has a deep sill, or seat, which was intended as one
of the accommodations for sitting down. This was not unfrequently
made with a recess in the middle, so as to form a seat on each side, on
which two persons might sit face to face, and which was thus more convenient
both for conversation, and for looking through the window at
what was going on without. This appears to have been a favourite seat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
with the female part of the household when employed in needlework and
other sedentary occupations. There is an allusion to this use of the
window sill in the curious old poem of the ‚ÄúLady Bessy,‚Äù which is probably
somewhat obscured by the alterations of the modern copyist; when
the young princess kneels before her father, he takes her up and seats her
in the window:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>I came before my father the king,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>And kneeled down upon my knee;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I desired him lowly of his blessing,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>And full soon he gave it unto me.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And in his arms he could me thring,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>And set me in a window so high.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The words of our inventory, ‚Äúa form to sit upon, and a chair,‚Äù
describe well the scanty furnishing of the rooms of a house at this period.
The cause of this poverty in movables, which arose more from the
general insecurity of property than the inability to procure it, is curiously
illustrated by a passage from a letter of Margaret Paston to her husband,
written early in the reign of Edward IV. ‚ÄúAlso,‚Äù says the lady to her
spouse, ‚Äúif ye be at home this Christmas, it were well done ye should do
purvey a garnish or twain of pewter vessel, two basins and two ewers, and
twelve candlesticks, for ye have too few of any of these to serve this place;
I am afraid to purvey much stuff in this place, till we be surer thereof.‚Äù
As yet, a form or bench continued to be the usual seat, which could be
occupied by several persons at once. One chair, as in the inventory just
mentioned, was considered enough for a room, and was no doubt preserved
for the person of most dignity, perhaps for the lady of the household.
Towards the latter end of this period, however, chairs, made in a
simpler form, and stools, the latter very commonly three-legged, became
more abundant. Yet in a will dated so late as 1522 (printed in the
‚ÄúBury Wills‚Äù of the Camden Society), an inhabitant of Bury in Suffolk,
who seems to have possessed a large house and a considerable quantity of
household furniture for the time, had, of tables and chairs, only ‚Äúa tabyll
of waynskott with to (<i>two</i>) joynyd trestelles, ij. joynyd stolys of the best,
a gret joynyd cheyre at the deyse in the halle&mdash;the grettest close cheyre,
ij. fote stoles&mdash;a rounde tabyll of waynskott with lok and key, the secunde
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
joynyd cheyer, ij. joynyd stolys.‚Äù The ordinary forms of chairs and stools
at the latter end of the fifteenth century are shown in our cut <a href="#n244">No. 244</a>,
taken from a very curious sculpture in alto-relievo on one of the columns
of the H√¥tel-de-Ville at Brussels. At this time we begin to find examples
of chairs ingeniously constructed, for folding up or taking to pieces, so as
to be easily laid aside or carried away. Some of these resemble exactly
our modern camp-stools. A curious bedroom
chair of this construction is represented
in our cut <a href="#n245">No. 245</a>, taken from
a fine illuminated manuscript of the
romance of the ‚ÄúComte d‚ÄôArtois,‚Äù of
the fifteenth century, in the collection of
M. Barrois of Paris, but now, I believe, in
the library of lord Ashburnham. The
construction of this chair is too evident
to need explanation. It explains the
phrase, used in some of our old writers,
of unfolding a chair.</p>

<p>At this time much greater use appears
to have been made of candles than
formerly, and they seem to have been constructed of different substances
and qualities. Candlesticks, made usually of the mixed metal called
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
laton or latten (an alloy of brass), were found in all houses; they appear
to have been still mostly made with a spike on which the candle was
stuck, and sometimes they were ornamented, and furnished with mottoes.
John Baret, who made his will at Bury, in 1463, possessed a ‚Äúcandylstykke
of laten with a pyke,‚Äù two ‚Äúlowe candylstikkez of a sorth,‚Äù (<i>i.e.</i>
to match), and three ‚Äúcandylstykkes of laton whereupon is wretyn <i>grace
me governe</i>.‚Äù A testament dated in 1493 enumerates ‚Äúa lowe candilstyke
of laton, oon of my candelstykes, and ij. high candilstykes of laton.‚Äù
In the will of Agas Herte of Bury, in 1522, ‚Äúij. belle canstykes and a
lesser canstyke,‚Äù occurs twice, so that they seem to have formed two sets,
and there is a third mention of ‚Äúij. bell canstykes.‚Äù We also find
mention at this time of double candlesticks, which were probably intended
to be placed in an elevated position to give light to the whole apartment.
Our inventory of the contents of the parlour contains ‚Äúa branch of latten,
with four lights,‚Äù which was no doubt intended for this purpose of lighting
the whole room (a sort of chandelier), and appears to have been identical
with the candlebeam, not unfrequently mentioned in the old inventories.
A widow of Bury, named Agnes Ridges,
who made her will in 1492, mentions
‚Äúmy candylbeme that hangyth in my
hall with vj. bellys of laton standyng
thereon,‚Äù <i>i.e.</i> six cups in which the
candles were placed. Our cut <a href="#n246">No. 246</a>
represents a candlebeam with four lights.
It is slung round a simple pulley in the
ceiling, by a string which was fixed to the
ground. It is taken from a manuscript
of the ‚ÄúTrait√© des Tournois‚Äù (treatise
of tournaments), by king Ren√©, in the
National Library at Paris, No. 8352; and
as the scene is represented as taking place
in a princely hall, which is fitted up for a festive entertainment, we may
take it as a curious proof of the rudeness which was still mixed up with the
magnificence of the fifteenth century. In a fine illumination in a manuscript
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
of Froissart in the British Museum (MS. Reg. 18 E. 2), representing
the fatal masque at the court of Charles VI. of France, in 1393, in which
several of the courtiers were burnt to death, we have, in the king‚Äôs
palace, a chandelier exactly like that in our last cut, except that each
candlestick on the beam contains two candles&mdash;a ‚Äúdouble candlestick.‚Äù
This manuscript is of the latter part of the fifteenth century. It had
been the custom, on festive occasions, or in ceremonies where large apartments
required to be lighted, to do this by means of torches which
servants held in their hands. This custom was very common, and is
frequently spoken of or alluded to in the medi√¶val writers. Nevertheless,
the inconvenience and even danger attending it, led to various plans for
superseding it. One of these was, to fix up against the walls of the room
frames for holding the torches, of which an example is given in the
accompanying cut (<a href="#n247">No. 247</a>), representing a torch-frame, still preserved in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
the Palazzo Strozzi at Florence. One of the group, it will be observed,
has a long spike, intended to hold a large candle. Candlesticks fixed to
the wall in various manners are seen in manuscripts of the fifteenth
century; and an example is given in our cut <a href="#n248">No. 248</a>, taken from a part
of the same illumination of Froissart mentioned before. The candle is
here placed before a little image, on the upper part of the fireplace, but
whether this was for a religious purpose or not, is not clear. In this cut,
the three princesses are seated on the large chair or settle, which is turned
with its back to the fire. This important article of furniture is now found
in the parlour as well as in the hall.</p>

FROM THE ‚ÄúNANCY‚Äù TAPESTRY.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">As</span> people began to have less taste for the publicity of the old hall,
they gradually withdrew from it into the parlours for many of
the purposes to which the hall was originally devoted, and thus the latter
lost much of its former character. The parlour was now the place
commonly used for the family meals. In a curious little treatise on
the ‚Äúmost vyle and detestable use of dyce play,‚Äù composed near the
beginning of the sixteenth century, one of the interlocutors is made to
say, ‚ÄúSo down we came again,‚Äù <i>i.e.</i> from the chambers above, ‚Äúinto the
parlour, and found there divers gentlemen, all strangers to me; and what
should I say more, but to dinner we went.‚Äù The dinner hour, we learn
from this same tract, was then at the hour of noon; ‚Äúthe table,‚Äù we are
told, ‚Äúwas fair spread with diaper cloths, the cupboard garnished with
much goodly plate.‚Äù The cupboard seems now to have been considered
a necessary article of furniture in the parlour; it had originally belonged
to the hall, and was of simple construction. One of the great objects of
ostentation in a rich man‚Äôs house was his plate; which, at dinner time,
he brought forth, and caused to be spread on a table in sight of his
guests; afterwards, to exhibit the plate to more advantage, the table was
made with shelves, or steps, on which the different articles could be
arranged in rows one above another. It was called in French and Anglo-Norman
a <i>buffet</i>, or a <i>dressoir</i> (dresser), the latter name, it is said, being
given to it because on it the different articles were <i>dress√©s</i>, or arranged.
The English had, in their own language, no special name for this article
of furniture, so that they called it literally a cup-board, or board for the
cups. In course of time, and especially when it was removed from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
hall into the parlour, this article was made more elaborately, and doors
were added to it, for shutting up the plate when not in use. It thus
became equivalent to our modern sideboard. We have seen a figure of
a cupboard of this more complicated structure in a cut in our last chapter;
and we shall have others of different forms in our next.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n249" src="images/i_n249.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 249. A Sick Room.</i></p></div>

<p>Our cut <a href="#n249">No. 249</a> is a good representation of the interior of a parlour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
furnished with the large seat, or settle, and with rather an elaborate and
elegant cupboard. The latter, however, does not belong to the picture
itself, having been introduced from another in the same manuscript by
Mr. Shaw, in his beautiful work the ‚ÄúDresses and Decorations of the
Middle Ages,‚Äù from which it is here taken. It is found in a fine manuscript
in the British Museum (MS. Reg. 15 D. 1), containing the French
translation of the ‚ÄúHistoria Scholastica‚Äù of Peter Comestor, and written
in the year 1470. The subject of this illumination is taken from the Scriptural
story of Tobit, who here lies sick and blind on the settle, having just
despatched his son Tobias on his journey to the city of Rages. The lady
cooking is no doubt intended for his wife Anna; it will be observed that
she is following the directions of a book. Cookery books and books of
medicinal receipts were now common. The kettle is suspended over the
fire by a jack of a construction that occurs not unfrequently in the manuscripts
of this period. The settle is placed with its back to the window,
which is covered with a large curtain.</p>

<p>As the parlours saved the domestic arrangements of the household
from the too great publicity of the hall, so on the other hand they
relieved the bedchambers from much of what had previously been
transacted in them, and thus rendered them more private. In the poem
of the ‚ÄúLady Bessie,‚Äù when the earl of Derby and Humphrey Brereton
visit the young princess, they are introduced to her in her bower, or
chamber, but she immediately conducts the latter into the parlour, in
order to converse with him:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>She took him in her arms, and kissed him times three;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>‚ÄúWelcome,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúHumphrey Brereton;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>How hast thou spedd in the west countrey?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>I pray thee tell me quickly and anon.‚Äù</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Into a parlour they went from thence,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>There were no more but hee and shee.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The female part of the family now passed in the parlour much of the
time which had been formerly passed in their chambers. It was often
their place of work. Young ladies, even of great families, were brought
up not only strictly, but even tyrannically, by their mothers, who kept
them constantly at work, exacted from them almost slavish deference and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
respect, and even counted upon their earnings. The parental authority
was indeed carried to an almost extravagant extent. There are some
curious instances of this in the correspondence of the Paston family.
Agnes Paston, the wife of sir William Paston, the judge, appears to have
been a very harsh mother. At the end of June 1454, Elizabeth Clere, a
kinswoman who appears to have lived in great intimacy with the family,
sent to John Paston, the lady‚Äôs eldest son, the following account of the
treatment of his sister Elizabeth, who was of marriageable age, and for
whom a man of the name of Scroope had been proposed as a husband.
‚ÄúTherefore, cousin,‚Äù writes Jane Clere, ‚Äúmeseemeth he were go for
my cousin your sister, without that ye might get her a better; and if ye
can get a better, I would advise you to labour it in as short time as ye
may goodly, for she was never in so great a sorrow as she is now-a-days,
for she may not speak with no man, whosoever come, nor even may see
nor speak with my man, nor with servants of her mother‚Äôs, but that she
beareth her on hand otherwise than she meaneth; and she hath since
Easter the most part been beaten once in the week, or twice, and sometimes
twice in a day, and her head broken in two or three places.
Wherefore, cousin, she hath sent to me by friar Newton in great counsel,
and prayeth me that I would send to you a letter of her heaviness, and
pray you to be her good brother, as her trust is in you.‚Äù In spite of her
anxiety to be married, Elizabeth Paston did not succeed at this time,
but she was soon afterwards transferred from her paternal roof to the
household of the lady Pole. It was still the custom to send young
ladies of family to the houses of the great to learn manners, and it was
not only a matter of pride and ostentation to be thus surrounded by a
numerous train, but the noble lady whom they served did not disdain to
receive payment for their board as well as employing them in profitable
work. In a memorandum of errands to London, written by Agnes
Paston on the 28th of January, 1457, one is a message to ‚ÄúElizabeth
Paston that she must use herself to work readily, as other gentlewomen
do, and somewhat to help herself therewith. Item, to pay the lady Pole
twenty-six shillings and eightpence for her board.‚Äù Margaret Paston, the
wife of John Paston, just mentioned, and daughter-in-law of Agnes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
seems to have been equally strict with her daughters. At the beginning
of the reign of Edward IV., she wrote to her son John concerning his
sister Anne, who had been placed in the house of a kinsman of the name
of Calthorpe. ‚ÄúSince ye departed,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúmy cousin Calthorpe sent
me a letter complaining in his writing that forasmuch as he cannot be
paid of his tenants as he hath been before this time, he proposeth to
lessen his household, and to live the straitlier, wherefore he desireth me to
purvey for your sister Anne; he saith she waxeth high (<i>grows tall</i>), and
it were time to purvey her a marriage. I marvel what causeth him to
write so now, either she hath displeased him, or else he hath taken her
with default; therefore I pray you commune with my cousin Clare at
London, and weet (<i>learn</i>) how he is disposed to her-ward, and send me
word, for I shall be fain to send for her, and with me she shall but lose
her time, and without she will be the better occupied she shall oftentimes
move (<i>vex</i>) me and put me in great inquietness; remember what labour
I had with your sister, therefore do your part to help her forth, that may
be to your worship and mine.‚Äù There certainly appears here no great
affection between mother and daughter.</p>

<p>Among other lessons, the ladies appear to have been taught to be
very demure and formal in their behaviour in company. Our cut <a href="#n250">No. 250</a>
represents a party of ladies and gentlemen in the parlour engaged in
conversation. It is taken from an illumination in the manuscript of the
romance of the ‚ÄúComte d‚ÄôArtois,‚Äù formerly in the possession of M. Barrois.
They are all apparently seated on benches, which seem in this instance to
be made like long chests, and placed along the sides of the wall as if they
served also for lockers. These appear to be the only articles of furniture
in the room. There is a certain conventional position in most of the
ladies of the party which has evidently been taught, even to the holding
of the hands crossed. The four ladies with the gentleman between them
are no doubt intended to be the attendants on the lady of the house,
holding towards her the position of Elizabeth and Anne Paston. We
have precisely the same conventional forms in the next cut (<a href="#n251">No. 251</a>),
which is taken from an illumination in a manuscript of the ‚ÄúLegenda
Aurea,‚Äù in the National Library in Paris (No. 6889). We see here the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
same demureness and formal crossing of the hands among the young
ladies, in presence of their dame. It may be observed that, in almost all
the contemporary pictures of domestic scenes, the men, represented as
visitors, keep their hats on their heads.</p>

<p>One of the most curious features in the first of these scenes is that of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
the cages, especially that of the squirrel, which is evidently made to turn
round with the animal‚Äôs motion, like squirrel-cages of the present day.
We have now frequent allusions to the keeping of birds in cages, and
parrots, magpies, jays, and various singing birds, are often mentioned
among domestic pets. During the earlier half of the century of which
we are now more especially speaking, the poems of Lydgate furnish
us with several examples. Thus, in that entitled ‚ÄúThe Chorle and
the Bird,‚Äù we are told&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The chorle</i> (countryman) <i>was gladde that he this birdde hadde take,</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Mery of chere, of looke, and of visage,</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And in al haste he cast for to make</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Within his house a pratie litelle cage,</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And with hir songe to rejoise his corage</i>.<br /></span>
</span></span>

And in another of Lydgate‚Äôs minor poems, it is said of Spring,&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Whiche sesoun prykethe</i> (stirs up) <i>fresshe corages,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Rejoissethe beastys walkyng in ther pasture,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Causith briddys to syngen in ther cages,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Whan blood renewyth in every creature</i>.<br /></span>
</span></span>

Among these, we find birds mentioned which are not now usually kept in
cages. Thus, in a manuscript of the time of Edward IV., we find a
receipt for food for that favourite bird of the medi√¶val poets, the nightingale.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>
Small animals of various kinds were also tamed and kept in the
house, either loose or in cages. The plot of some of the earlier fabliaux
turns upon the practice of taming squirrels as pets, and keeping them in
cages; and this animal continued long to be an especial favourite, for its
liveliness and activity. In one of the compartments of the curious
tapestry of Nancy, of the fifteenth century, which has been engraved by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
M. Achille Jubinal, we see a lady with a tame squirrel in her hand,
which she holds by a string, as represented in our cut <a href="#n252">No. 252</a>.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img id="n252" src="images/i_n252.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 252. Lady and Squirrel.</i></p></div>

<p>The parlour was now the room where the domestic amusements were
introduced. The guest in the early tract on ‚ÄúDyce Play,‚Äù quoted in a
former page, tells us, ‚Äúand, after the table was removed, in came
one of the waiters with a fair silver bowl, full of dice and cards. Now,
masters, quoth the goodman, who is so disposed, fall too.‚Äù Gambling
was carried to a great height during the
fifteenth century, and was severely condemned
by the moralists, but without much
success. Dice were the older implements of
play, and tables (or backgammon). A religious
poem on saints‚Äô days, in a manuscript written
about the year 1460, warning against idle
amusements, says&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Also use not to pley at the dice ne at the tablis,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ne none maner gamys, uppon the holidais;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Use no tavernys where be jestis and fablis,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Syngyng of lewde balettes, rondelettes, or virolais.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

After the middle of the fifteenth century,
cards came into very general use; and at the
beginning of the following century, there was such a rage for card-playing,
that an attempt was made early in the reign of Henry VIII. to
restrict their use by law to the period of Christmas. When, however,
people sat down to dinner at noon, and had no other occupation for the
rest of the day, they needed amusement of some sort to pass the time;
and a poet of the fifteenth century observes truly,&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>A man may dryfe forthe the day that long tyme dwellis</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With harpyng and pipyng, and other mery spellis,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i10"><i>With gle, and wyth game.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

Such amusements as these mentioned, with games of different kinds in
which the ladies took part, and dancing, generally occupied the afternoon,
from dinner to supper, the hour of which latter meal seems usually to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
have been six o‚Äôclock. The favourite amusement was dancing. A family
party at the dance is represented in our cut <a href="#n253">No. 253</a>, from M. Barrois‚Äô
manuscript of the ‚ÄúComte d‚ÄôArtois.‚Äù The numerous dances which were
now in vogue seem to have completely eclipsed the old carole, or round
dance, and the latter word, which was a more general one, had displaced
the former. The couple here on their legs are supposed to be performing
one of the new and tasteful fashionable dances, which were much more
lively than those of the earlier period; some of them were so much so as
to scandalise greatly the sage moralists of the time. The after-dinner
amusements were resumed after supper; and a practice had now established
itself of prolonging the day‚Äôs enjoyment to a late hour, and taking
a second, or, as it was called, a rere-supper (<i>arri√®re souper</i>), which was
called the banquet in France, where the three great meals were now the
dinner, the supper, and the banquet, and dinner appears to have been
considered as the least meal of the three. It was thus, probably, that,
in course of time, dinner took the place of supper, and supper that of
banquet.</p>

<p>We have a very curious illustration of the extravagant living at table
of the latter half of the fifteenth century, in the curious allegorical
tapestry long preserved at Nancy, in Lorrain, and said by tradition, probably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
with truth, to have been the ornament of the tent of Charles le T√©m√©raire,
duke of Burgundy, when he laid siege to Nancy in 1477, and was
defeated and slain. It is of Flemish workmanship, and no doubt pictures
the manners of the Burgundian nobles and gentry, but at that time the
court of Burgundy was the model of the fashionable life of western
Europe. It happens, curiously enough, that a few years later a rather
obscure French writer, named Nicole de La Chesnaye, compiling one of
those allegorical dramas then so popular under the title of ‚ÄúMoralities,‚Äù
took the story of this tapestry as his subject, and has thus left us the full
explanation of what might otherwise have been not easily understood.
The title of this morality is ‚ÄúLa Nef de Sant√©‚Äù (the ship of health), and
a second title is ‚ÄúLa condamnacion des bancquetz‚Äù (the condemnation
of banquets); and its object is to show the unhappy consequences of the
extravagance in eating and drinking, which then prevailed. It opens
with a conversation between three allegorical personages named Dinner,
Supper, and Banquet, who declare their intention to lead joyous life
evening and morning, and they resolve on imitating Passe-Temps (pastime)
and Bonne-Compagnie (good company). At this moment Bonne-Compagnie
herself, who is described as a dashing damsel (<i>gorri√®re
damoiselle</i>), enters with all her people, namely, Gourmandize (greediness),
Friandize (daintiness), Passe-Temps, already mentioned, Je-Boy-√†-Vous
(I drink to you), Je-Pleige-d‚ÄôAutant (I pledge the same), and Acoustumance
(custom). Each names what he prefers in good cheer, and Bonne-Compagnie,
to begin the day, orders a collation, at which, among other
things, are served damsons (<i>prunes de Damas</i>), which appear at this time
to have been considered as delicacies. There is here a marginal direction
to the purport that, if the morality should be performed in the season
when real damsons could not be had, the performers must have some
made of wax to look like real ones. They now take their places at table,
and, while they are eating, Je-Boy-√†-Vous calls the attention of the company
to the circumstance that Gourmandize, in his haste to eat the
damsons, had swallowed a snail. Passe-Temps next proposes a dance, and
chooses for his partner the lady Friandize, comparing her to Helen, and
telling her that he was Paris. She, in reply, compares herself to Medea,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
and her partner to Jason. Then the musicians, ‚Äúplaced on a stage or
some higher place,‚Äù are to play a measure ‚Äúpretty short.‚Äù Dinner,
Supper, and Banquet next make their appearance, and, addressing Bonne-Compagnie,
make their apology for entering without being invited; but
the lady receives them well, asks their names, and, in return, tells them
those of her people. Dinner, to show his gratitude for this friendly
reception, invites the whole party to go to his feast, which is just ready;
and Supper invites them to a second repast, and Banquet to a third.
They accept the invitation of Dinner, and are served with <i>friture</i>, <i>brouet</i>,
<i>potage</i>, <i>gros p√¢t√©s</i>, &amp;c. Meanwhile Supper and Banquet look upon the
party from ‚Äúsome high window,‚Äù and converse on the consequences
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
likely to follow their excesses. This scene is represented in the first compartment
of the tapestry, as it now exists (for it has undergone considerable
mutilation), and is represented in our cut <a href="#n254">No. 254</a>. It is a good
picture of a seignorial repast of the fifteenth century. There are people
at table, besides those enumerated in the morality, who are here indicated
by their names: Passe-Temps at one end of the table, a lady to his left,
and after her Je-Boy-√†-Vous, who has Bonne-Compagnie by his side, and
to her left Dinner, the host. To the right of Passe-Temps sits the lady
Gourmandize, and to her right Je-Vous-Pleige (I pledge you), and next
to him Friandize. The cups in which they are drinking are flat-shaped,
and appear, by the colours in the original, to be of glass, with the brims,
and other parts in some, gilt. The minstrels, in the gallery, are playing
with trumpets. Among the attendants, we see the court fool, with his
bauble, who had now become an ordinary, and almost a necessary, personage
in the household of the rich; it was the result of an increasing
taste for the coarse buffoonery which characterised an unrefined state of
society. The court fool was licensed to utter with impunity whatever
came to his thought, however mordant or however indecent. Beside
him are two valets with dogs, which appear to have been usually admitted
to the hall, and to have eaten the refuse on the spot. A window above
gives us a view of the country, with buildings in the distance, and Supper
and Banquet looking in upon the company. An inscription in the upper
corner to the right tells us how these two personages came slyly to look
at the assembly, and how through envy they conspired to take vengeance
upon the feasters&mdash;</p>

<p>The morality next introduces the Diseases who are to be the executors
of the vengeance of Supper and Banquet, and who, according to the
stage directions, are to be dressed ‚Äúvery strangely, so that you would
hardly know whether they are women or men.‚Äù These are Apoplexy,
Paralysis, Pleurisy, Cholic, Quinsy, Dropsy, Jaundice, Gravel, and Gout.
At the end of this scene, Supper and Banquet address themselves to these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
people, and ask them to undertake an assault on Bonne-Compagnie and
the other guests of Dinner; and they consent at once, and Supper places
them in an ambuscade in his dwelling. Meanwhile the feast ends, and
Bonne-Compagnie says grace, and orders the player on the lute to
perform his duty, whereupon ‚Äúthe instrument sounds, and the three men
shall lead out the three women, and shall dance whatever dance they
please, while Bonne-Compagnie remains seated.‚Äù Supper and Banquet
then present themselves in turn to invite Bonne-Compagnie and her
people, and they go first to Supper, who receives them with extraordinary
hospitality. But Supper was a wicked traitor; and the stage directions
inform us that, while the guests were enjoying themselves, his agents, the
Diseases, were to be introduced watching them through a window. As
soon as the substantial viands are eaten, Supper goes to order what was
called the <i>issue</i>, or dessert; and in his absence Bonne-Compagnie orders
the minstrels to play an air, and they obey. While the dessert is preparing,
Supper goes to the Diseases, to ask if they are ready, and they arm
and attack the guests, overthrowing tables and benches, and treating
everybody with great cruelty. After some other scenes, Banquet comes
to announce that his feast is ready, condoles with the sufferers on the
treatment they had received from Supper, though he is meditating still
greater treachery himself, and they go and feast with him. The Diseases,
ready at his command, make a much more fatal attack upon the guests.</p>

<p>Banquet‚Äôs feast forms the second compartment of the tapestry of
Nancy in its present state, and is represented in our cut <a href="#n255">No. 255</a>. When
compared with the morality, it presents some variations. In front,
Banquet is standing before the table, opposite to Je-Boy-√†-Vous and
Je-Pleige-d‚ÄôAutant, and appears to be replying to Bonne-Compagnie,
who is seated between Passe-Temps and Acoustumance. Further to the
left Banquet appears again, with his hand on his sword, addressing the
Diseases, who are at the entrance of the hall, waiting for his signal for
the attack. At the lower corner on the left we see Supper, talking with
another important personage, probably intended to represent Dinner.
Above, to the right, through a window, we see Banquet again, with one
of his attendants fastening on his armour, while another holds his casque,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
which he has not yet placed on his head. The first of the inscriptions in
this compartment of the tapestry, which is on the left, tells how, while
the guests are feasting in all jollity, Banquet and his rout arm and come
to slaughter the whole assembly&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Chiere ilz tyrent joyeulsement,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Y estant Bancquet et la route</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Qui s‚Äôarmerent et l√† proprement</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Occirent l‚Äôassembl√©e toute.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The second inscription consists of eight lines moralizing on the final ruin
which often falls on those who make enjoyment the business of their
lives:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Les trois folz ont grant volont√©</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>De cherche[r] leur malle meschance;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Quant on a bien ris et chant√©,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A la fin fault tourner la chance.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ha! vous vellez avoir plaisance!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Bien l‚Äôaur√© vous ung tandis;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>M√®s gens quy prenent leur aisence,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>En fin se treuvent plus mauldiz.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

It is remarkable that these eight lines, taken from the tapestry, are introduced
into the morality, and placed in the mouth of the fool at the end
of the first scene.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n255" src="images/i_n255.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 255. A Banquet in the Fifteenth Century.</i></p></div>

<p>It will be remarked at once that there is a much greater display of
luxury in the banquet scene than in the dinner scene. Upon the table
are two peacocks, each with a shield hung to its neck, no doubt to show
the armorial bearings of the host; a boar‚Äôs head, dressed in the most
fashionable manner; a subtelty, representing a ship filled with birds,
surrounded by a sea full of fishes, and having a tall mast, with a sail made
of silk and ermine, and surmounted by a figure of a naked female,
intended probably to represent the goddess Venus. There are also on
the table four candles, of coloured wax. A noble dresser stands against
the wall, covered with vessels of gold and of glass, but the metal far
predominates. The minstrels are standing apparently on the floor on a
level with the guests, and consist of a man playing on the cittern, or
lute, a harper, and one who plays on the pipe and drum, the latter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
instrument a substitute for the tabor. The valets with the dogs are again
introduced, but we miss the court fool.</p>

<p>The remaining portions of the tapestry represent the attack of the
Diseases, and the great havoc they made among the guests.</p>

<p>The banquet was known in England by that name, as well as by the
name of rere-supper. In the curious English morality play, entitled
‚ÄúThe Interlude of the Four Elements,‚Äù printed early in the sixteenth
century, the same distinction is made between the three meals as in the
French morality described above. Sensual-appetite, one of the characters
in the piece, leads Humanity to the tavern to dine, and orders a dinner
of three courses, with a choice variety of wines. As they are leaving
after dinner, the taverner reminds them that they were to return to
supper; and then Humanity proposes a cup of ‚Äúnew‚Äù wine, as though
wine was then valued for being new. Food and liquor were formerly
adulterated in more dishonest manner even than in modern times, and
the taverner answers the demand jokingly&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ye shall have wyne as newe as can be,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For I may tell you in pryvyt√©</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hit was brued but yester nyght.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

But he immediately adds&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>But than I have for your apetyte</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A cup of wyne of olde claret;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>There is no better, by this lyght.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

After supper they go to dance, and meanwhile Sensual-appetite goes
to prepare the banquet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span></p>

<p>In ‚ÄúAcolastus,‚Äù a work by the grammarian Palsgrave, published in
1540, the banquet is still identified with the rere-supper, when he speaks
of ‚Äúthe rere-supper, or banket, where men syt downe to drynke and
eate agayne after their meate.‚Äù And again, still later, Higins, in his
‚ÄúNomenclator,‚Äù published in 1585, explains the Latin word <i>poc≈ìnium</i>
by ‚Äúa reare-supper, or a banket after supper.‚Äù The term rere-supper
was in use throughout the fifteenth century. An English vocabulary of
that century speaks of a meal between dinner and supper, under the
name of ‚Äúa myd-dyner under-mete,‚Äù the same which, no doubt, was
called by a French word, a <i>bever</i>, as consisting especially in taking a drink,
and which, removed to the time between breakfast and dinner, is now
called a luncheon.</p>

<p>In the introduction to Lydgate‚Äôs ‚ÄúStory of Thebes,‚Äù which is introduced
as a continuation of the ‚ÄúCanterbury Tales,‚Äù the poet pretends to
have arrived at the inn in Canterbury when it was occupied by the
pilgrims, who invite him to sup with them, and he joins their company.
‚ÄúOur host,‚Äù who is the leader of the pilgrims, offers him his place at their
supper heartily:

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Praying you</i> (he says) <i>to suppe with us this night,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And ye shall have made, at your devis,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A great pudding, or a round hagis,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A French moile, a tansie, or a froise</i>.<br /></span>
</span></span>

These appear to have been the usual favourite dishes at an ordinary
supper of this date (the first half of the fifteenth century). The <i>hagis</i>
appears to have been much the same dish as the Scottish haggis of the
present day. The <i>moile</i> was a dish made of marrow and grated bread.
The <i>tansie</i> was a kind of omelet, resembling apparently what the French
now call an <i>omelette aux fines herbes</i>; while the <i>froise</i> had small strips of
bacon in it&mdash;an <i>omelette au lard</i>. This latter was a very favourite dish
among the monks. After supper, the guests, or at least some of them,
are represented as taking ‚Äústrong nottie ale‚Äù before going to bed. They
rise early, ‚Äúanon as it is day,‚Äù and start on their return towards
London; and they take no meal before dinner, having it</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Fully in purpose to come to dinere</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Unto Ospring, and breake there our fast.</i><br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
</div></div>

<p>There is a longer preface to the supplementary tale of ‚ÄúBeryn,‚Äù
written about the same date as the ‚ÄúStory of Thebes,‚Äù and printed in
the edition of Chaucer‚Äôs works by Urry, in which the divisions of the day
are tolerably well described. The pilgrims there arrived at their destination
in Canterbury ‚Äúat mydmorowe,‚Äù which is interpreted in the
glossaries as meaning nine o‚Äôclock in the forenoon, and then took their
lodgings, ‚Äúordeyned‚Äù their dinner, and, while it was preparing, went to
make their offerings to the shrine of St. Thomas in the cathedral church.
Meanwhile the Pardoner had separated from the company, and engaged
in a low intrigue with the ‚Äútapster,‚Äù or barmaid, who offers him a drink,
but he tells her he had not yet broken his fast&mdash;we are to conclude that
this was the case with the rest of the company&mdash;and

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>She start into the town, and set a py al hote.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

Meat pies appear to have been very common articles of food in the
middle ages, and to have been kept always ready at the cooks‚Äô shops.
The offering seems to have taken but a small space of time, and then&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>They set their signys upon their hedes, and som oppon their capp,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And sith to the dyner-ward they gan for to stapp</i> (step);<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Every man in his degr√© wissh</i> (washed) <i>and toke his sete,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>As they wer wont to doon at soper and at mete;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And wer in silence for a tyme, tyl good ale gan arise</i>.<br /></span>
</span></span>

It appears, therefore, that people did not hold conversation while eating,
but that the talk and mirth began with the liquor, whether ale or wine.
It was then agreed that they should remain that day in Canterbury, and
all sup together at night&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‚Äú<i>Then al this after-mete I hold it for the best</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To sport and pley us,‚Äù quod the hoost, ‚Äúech man as hym lest</i> (likes),<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And go by tyme to soper, and to bed also,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>So mowe we erly rysen, our jorney for to do</i>‚Äù.<br /></span>
</span></span>

Accordingly they all walk forth into the city, where the knight, who with
his son had put on fresh gowns, took the latter to the town walls to
explain to him their strength, and the character of the defences; and as
many of the rest as had changes of apparel with them imitated their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
example, and they separated in parties, according to their different
tastes. The monk, the parson, and the friar, went to visit some clerical
acquaintance, and indulged in spiced wine. The ladies remained at
home:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The wyfe of Bath was so wery, she had no wyl to walk;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She toke the priores by the honde, ‚ÄúMadam, wol ye stalk</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Pryvely into the garden to se the herbis growe?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And after with our hostis wife in her parlour rowe</i> (talk)?<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I wol gyve yowe the wyne, and ye shul me also;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For tyl we go to soper we have naught ellis to do.</i>‚Äù<br /></span>
</span></span>

The prioress assents to this proposal&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&mdash;<i>and forth gon they wend,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Passing forth sofftly into the herbery;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For many a herb grew for sewe</i> (pottage) <i>and surgery;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And all the aleys fair and parid, and raylid, and ymakid;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The sauge and the isope yfrethid and istakid;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And othir beddis by and by fresh ydight,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For comers to the hooste right a sportful sight</i>.<br /></span>
</span></span>

When the guests reassembled, they agreed that the knight should be
their ‚Äúmarshall‚Äù of the table, and he ordered them all to wash, and then
appointed them to their seats, that they might be properly seated together,
for this was part of his duty. They thus sat two and two, each couple,
no doubt, at one dish&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>They wissh</i> (washed), <i>and sett right as he bad, eche man wyth his fere,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And begonne to talk of sportis and of chere</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That they had the aftir-mete whiles they wer out;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For othir occupacioune, tyll they wer servid about,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>They had not at that tyme, but eny man kitt</i> (cut) <i>a loff</i>.<br /></span>
</span></span>

Thus it would appear that nothing eatable was as yet placed on the table
but bread. Presently, the supper was served round to them, of which
there was only one ‚Äúservice,‚Äù out of courtesy on the part of the rich
members of the company towards those who were poor, as there was to
be an equal division of the expenses of the supper. In return, the highest
places of the table were yielded to the persons of best estate, and these,
as an acknowledgment, gave a cup of wine round at their own expense,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
and then left the table to retire to their beds. But the less genteel of
the company, the miller and the cook, with the sompnour, the yeoman,
the reeve, and the manciple, remained ‚Äúdrinking by the moon,‚Äù&mdash;that
is, they had no candle. There was, however, one candle in the bedroom,
which seems to have served to light the whole company,&mdash;for it is evident
that they all slept in beds in one room,&mdash;and this candle was only put out
when they were all gone to bed, which was the moment the Pardoner
awaited to steal away and pursue his intrigue. Next morning they were
out of their beds so early that they left the town on their homeward
journey at sunrise.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> chambers were now, except in smaller houses, mostly above the

chamber was much greater than formerly. In the poem of ‚ÄúLady

<p class="caption"><i>No. 257. The Nursing Chamber.</i></p></div>

<p>The description given in these lines agrees perfectly with the representations
of chambers in the illuminated manuscripts of the latter part
of the fifteenth century, when the superior artistic skill of the illuminators
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
enabled them to draw interiors with more of detail than in former periods.
We have almost invariably the chimney, and one ‚Äúrich chair,‚Äù if not
more. In our cut <a href="#n256">No. 256</a>, we have a settle in the chamber, which is
turned to the fire. This picture is taken from a manuscript of the early
French translation of Josephus, in the National Library in Paris (No.
7015), and represents the death of the emperor Nero, as described by that
writer. All the furniture of this chamber is of a superior description.
The large chair by the bed-side is of very elegant design; and the settle,
which is open at the back, is ornamented with carved panels. Our next
cut (<a href="#n257">No. 257</a>), taken from a manuscript of Lydgate‚Äôs metrical Life of
St. Edmund (MS. Harl. No. 2278), represents the birth of that saint.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
This room is more elaborately furnished than the former. The fittings
of the bed are richer; the chimney is more ornamental in its character,
and is curious as having three little recesses for holding candlesticks, cups,
and other articles; and we have a well-supplied cupboard, though of
simple form. From the colours in the manuscript, all the vessels appear
to be of gold, or of silver-gilt. The seat before the fire in this cut
(<a href="#n257">No. 257</a>) seems to be the hutch, or chest, which in Nos. 261 and 262
we shall see placed at the foot of the bed, from which it is here moved to
serve the occasion.</p>

<p>The lady seated on this chest appears to be wrapping up the new-born
infant in swaddling-clothes; a custom which, as I have remarked on a
former occasion, and as we shall see again further on, prevailed universally
till a comparatively recent period. Infants thus wrapped up are frequently
seen in the illuminated manuscripts; and their appearance is
certainly anything but picturesque. We have an exception in one of the
sculptures on the columns of the H√¥tel de Ville at Brussels (represented
in our cut <a href="#n258">No. 258</a>), which also furnishes us with a curious example of a
cradle of the latter part of the fifteenth century.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n258" src="images/i_n258.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 258. A Cradle.</i></p></div>

<p>It will, no doubt, have been remarked that in these cuts we observe
no traces of carpets on the floor. In our cut <a href="#n256">No. 256</a>, the floor is evidently
boarded; but more generally, as in our cuts Nos. 257, 260, and 261, it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
appears chequered, or laid out in small squares, which may be intended to
represent tiles, or perhaps parquetry. There is more evidence of tapestried
or painted walls; although this kind of ornamentation is only used
partially, and chiefly in the dwellings of the richer classes. The walls
in the chamber in cut <a href="#n257">No. 257</a> appear to be painted. In the same cut
we have an example of an ornamental mat.</p>

<p>The most important article of furniture in the chamber was the bed,
which began now to be made much more ornamental than in previous
times. We have seen in the former period the introduction of the canopy
and its curtains, under which the head of the bed was placed. The
<i>celure</i>, or roof, of the canopy, was now often enlarged, so as to extend
over the whole bed; and it, as well as the <i>tester</i>, or back, was often
adorned with the arms of the possessor, with religious emblems, with
flowers, or with some other ornament. There were also sometimes <i>costers</i>,
or ornamental cloths for the sides of the bed. The curtains, sometimes
called by the French word <i>ridels</i>, were attached edgeways to the tester,
and were suspended sometimes by rings, so as to draw backwards and
forwards along a pole; but more frequently, to judge by the illuminations,
they were fixed to the celure in the same manner as to the tester, and
were drawn up with cords. At the two corners of the celure portions of
curtain were left hanging down like bags. The curtains which draw up
are represented in our cuts Nos. 259 and 260. Those in cuts Nos. 261
and 262, if not in Nos. 256 and 257, are evidently drawn along poles
with rings. The latter method is thus alluded to in the old metrical
romance of ‚ÄúSir Degrevant:‚Äù&mdash;</p>

<p>The celure and tester were fixed to the wall and ceiling of the apartment,
and were not in any way attached to the bed itself; for the large
four-post bedsteads were introduced in the sixteenth century. In some
illuminations the bed is seen placed within a square compartment separated
from the room by curtains which seem to be suspended from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
roof. This appears to have been the first step towards the more modern
four-post bedsteads. In one of the plates to D‚ÄôAgincourt‚Äôs ‚ÄúHistoire de
l‚ÄôArt‚Äù (Peinture, pl. 109), taken from a Greek fresco of the twelfth or
thirteenth century in a church at Florence, we have the curtains arranged
thus in a square tent in the room, where the cords are not suspended
from the roof, but supported by four corner-posts. The bed is placed
within, totally detached from the surrounding posts and curtains. The
space thus left between the bed and the curtains was perhaps what was
originally called in French the <i>ruelle</i> (literally, the ‚Äúlittle street‚Äù) of the
bed, a term which was afterwards given to the space between the curtains
of the bed and the wall, which held rather an important place in old
French chamber life, and especially in the stories of chamber intrigue.</p>

<p>The bedstead itself was still a very simple structure of wood, as shown
in our cut <a href="#n259">No. 259</a>, which represents the bed of a countess. It is taken
from the manuscript of the romance of the ‚ÄúComte d‚ÄôArtois,‚Äù which has
already furnished subjects for our previous chapters on the manners of the
fifteenth century. The lady‚Äôs footstool is no less rude than the bedstead.
The bed here evidently consists of a hard mattress. It was still often
made of straw, and the bed is spoken of in the glossaries as placed upon a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
<i>stramentum</i>, which is interpreted by the English word ‚Äúlitter;‚Äù but
feather-beds were certainly in general use during the whole of the
fifteenth century. In the latter part of the fourteenth century, Chaucer
(Dreme, v. 250) thus described a very rich bed:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Of downe of pure dovis white</i><br /></span>

Agnes Hubbard, a lady of Bury, in Suffolk, who made her will in 1418,
left among other things, ‚Äúone feather-bed‚Äù (<i>unum lectum de plumis</i>).
A rich townsman of the same place bequeathed, in 1463, to his niece,
‚Äúcerteyne stuffe of ostilment,‚Äù among which he enumerates ‚Äúmy grene
hanggyd bedde steynyd with my armys therin, that hanggith in the

next, tho that be of the same soort, a grete pilve (<i>pillow</i>) and a smal
pilve; the fethirbeed is hire owne that hire maistresse gaf hire at London.‚Äù
After enumerating other articles of different kinds, the testator proceeds&mdash;‚ÄúAnd
I geve hire the selour and the steynyd clooth of the coronacion of
Our Lady, with the clothes of myn that long to the bedde that she hath
loyen (<i>lain</i>) in, and the beddyng in the draught chamber for hire servaunth
to lyn in; and a banker of grene and red lying in hire chambyr
with the longe chayer (<i>a settle, probably</i>); and a stondyng coffre and a
long coffre in the drawth chambyr.‚Äù William Honyboorn, also of Bury,
bequeathed to his wife in 1493, ‚Äúmy best ffether bedde with the traunsome,
a whyte selour and a testour theron, with iij. white curteyns therto,
a coverlight white and blewe lyeng on the same bedde, with the blankettes.‚Äù
The same man leaves to his daughter, ‚Äúa ffether bedde next
the best, a materas lyeng under the same, iiij. peyr shetys, iij. pelowes, a
peyr blankettes.‚Äù John Coote, who made his will at Bury in 1502, left
to his wife, for term of her life, ‚Äúalle my plate, brasse, pewter, hanggynges,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
celers, testers, fetherbeddes, traunsoms, coverlytes, blankettes, shetes,
pelows, and all other stuff of hussold (<i>household</i>);‚Äù and afterwards bequeaths
these articles separately to his son and daughter, after their
mother‚Äôs death:&mdash;‚ÄúI will that William Coote have my beste hanged
bede, celer, testor, and curteyns longgyng to the same, the beste fetherbede,

shetes; and Alys Coote to have the next hanged bede, celer, and testour,
wyth the ij<sup>de</sup> fetherbede, blankettes, and the ij<sup>de</sup> peyer shetes.‚Äù In the
will of Anne Barett, of Bury, dated in 1504, we read, ‚ÄúItem, I bequeth
to Avyse <i>my servaunte</i> x. marc, a ffether bed, a traunsom, a payre shetes,
a payre blankettes, a coverlyght.‚Äù Lastly, the will of Agar Herte, a
widow of the same town, made in 1522, contains the following items:&mdash;‚ÄúItem,
I bequethe to Richard Jaxson, my son, a ffetherbed, ij. trawnsoms,
a matras, ij. pelowes, iiij. payer of schetes, a payer of blankettes, and a

<p>These extracts from only one set of wills are sufficient to show the
great advance which our forefathers had made during the fourteenth
century in the comfort and richness of their beds, and how cautious we
ought to be in receiving general observations on the condition of previous
ages by those who write at a subsequent period. I make this observation
in allusion to the account so often quoted from Harrison, who, in the
description of England written in Essex during the reign of Elizabeth,
and inserted in Holinshed‚Äôs ‚ÄúChronicles,‚Äù informs us that ‚Äúour fathers
(yea, and we our selves also) have lien full oft upon straw pallets, on
rough mats, covered onelie with a sheet, under coverlets made of dagswain,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
or hopharlots (I use their owne termes), and a good round log
under their heads instead of a bolster. If it were so that our fathers, or
the good-man of the house, had, within seven years after his mariage,
purchased a matteres, or flocke bed, and thereto a sacke of chaffe to reste
his heade upon, he thought himselfe to be as well lodged as the lord of
the towne, so well were they contented. Pillowes, said they, were
thought meete onelie for women in child-bed. As for servants, if they
had anie sheet above them it was well, for seldom had they anie under
their bodies to keepe them from the pricking straws that ran oft through
the canvas of the pallet, and rased their hardened hides.‚Äù A description
like this could only apply to the lower classes in society, who had as yet
participated but little in the march of social improvement.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 260. A. Truckle-bed.</i></p></div>

<p>As the privacy of the chamber had become greater, it seems now to
have been much less common in private mansions for several people to sleep
in the same room, which appears more rarely to have had more than one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
bed. But a bed of a new construction had now come into use, called a
truckle or trundle bed. This was a smaller bed which rolled under the
larger bed, and was designed usually for a valet, or servant. The illuminations
in the manuscript of the romance of the ‚ÄúComte d‚ÄôArtois,‚Äù
already quoted more than once, furnish us with the early example of a
truckle-bed represented in our cut <a href="#n260">No. 260</a>. The count d‚ÄôArtois lies in
the bed under the canopy, while the truckle-bed is occupied by his valet
(in this case, his wife in disguise). The truckle-bed is more frequently
mentioned in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Every reader will
remember the speech of mine host of the Garter, in the ‚ÄúMerry Wives
of Windsor‚Äù (act iv. sc. 5), who says of Falstaff‚Äôs room, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs his
chamber, his house, his castle, his standing bed and truckle-bed.‚Äù It was
the place allotted to the squire, when accompanying the knight on
‚Äúadventures.‚Äù So in Hudibras (part ii. canto ii.)&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>When Hudibras, whom thoughts and aking</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>‚ÄôTwixt sleeping kept all night and waking,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>And from his couch prepared to rise,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>But first, with knocking loud and bawling,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He roused the squire, in truckle lolling.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

In the English universities, the master-of-arts had his pupil to sleep in his
truckle-bed.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 261. A Bedroom Scene.</i></p></div>

<p>The chamber, as the most private part of the house, was stored with
chests and coffers, in which the person who occupied it kept his money,
his deeds and private papers, and his other valuables. Margaret Paston,
writing from Norwich to her husband about the year 1459, gives a curious
account of the preparations for his reception at home. ‚ÄúI have,‚Äù she
says, ‚Äútaken the measure in the drawte chamber, there as ye would your
coffers and your cowntewery (<i>supposed to mean a desk for writing</i>) should
be set for the while, and there is no space beside the bed, though the bed
were removed to the door, for to set both your board (<i>table</i>) and your
coffers there, and to have space to go and sit beside; wherefore I have
purveyed that ye shall have the same drawte chamber (<i>withdrawing room&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
origin of our name of drawing-room for the salon</i>) that ye had
before, thereat ye shall lye to yourself; and when your gear is removed
out of your little house, the door shall be locked, and your bags laid in
one of the great coffers, so that they shall be safe, I trust.‚Äù The hucches
(<i>hutches</i>) or chests, and coffers, in the bed-chamber, are frequently mentioned
in old writings. The large hutch seems to have been usually
placed at the foot of the bed. In one of our preceding cuts (<a href="#n257">No. 257</a>)
we have seen it moved from its place to make a temporary seat before
the fire. The cut annexed (<a href="#n261">No. 261</a>), taken from a manuscript Latin
Bible in the National Library in Paris (No. 6829), shows us the hutch
in its usual place, and opened so as to expose its contents to our view.
It is here evidently filled with money, and the persons who have entered
the chamber seem to be plundering it. In a very popular old story, the
same in substance as that of Macbeth and his daughters, an old man, on
the marriage of his daughter, weakly gives up all his property to the
young married pair, trusting to their filial love for his sustenance, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
they go on treating him worse and worse, until he is saved from actual
destitution by a deception he practises upon them. In one version of the
story, given in English verse in a manuscript of the fifteenth century, the
father goes to a friend and borrows a large sum of money in gold, which
he places in his coffer, and, having invited them to his dwelling, and
persuaded them to remain all night, he contrives that early in the morning
they shall, as by accident, espy him counting his gold. The unfilial
children, who supposed that he had given them all he possessed, were
astonished to find him still rich, and were induced, by their covetousness,
to treat him better during the rest of his life. The poem describes the
old man leaving his bed to count the gold in his chest:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

</span></span>

Robbers, or plunderers in time of war, when breaking into a house,
always made direct for the chamber. Among the letters of the Paston
family, is a paper by a retainer of sir John Fastolf, who had a house in
Southwark, giving an account of his sufferings during the attack upon
London by Jack Cade and the commons of Kent in 1450, in which he
tells how ‚Äúthe captain (Cade) sent certain of his meny to my chamber
in your rents, and there broke up my chest, and took away one obligation
of mine that was due unto me of 36<i>l.</i> by a priest of Paul‚Äôs and one other
obligation of one Knight of 10<i>l.</i>, and my purse with five rings of gold,
and 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> of gold and silver; and one harness (<i>suit of armour</i>) complete
of the touch of Milan; and one gown of fine perse blue, furred
with martens; and two gowns, one furred with bogey (<i>budge</i>), and one
other lined with frieze.‚Äù One of John Paston‚Äôs correspondents, writing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
from London on the 28th of October, 1455, gives the following still more
pertinent account of the robbing of a man‚Äôs house:&mdash;‚ÄúAlso there is great
variance between the earl of Devonshire and the lord Bonvile, as hath
been many day, and much debate is like to grow thereby; for on Thursday
at night last past, the earl of Devonshire‚Äôs son and heir came, with
sixty men of arms, to Radford‚Äôs place in Devonshire, which (Radford)
was of counsel with my lord Bonvile; and they set a house on fire at
Radford‚Äôs gate, and cried and made a noise as though they had been sorry
for the fire; and by thet cause Radford‚Äôs men set open the gates and
yede (<i>went</i>) out to see the fire; and forthwith the earl‚Äôs son aforesaid
entered into the place, and entreated Radford to come down of his
chamber to speak with them, promising him that he should no bodily
harm have; upon which promise he came down, and spoke with the said
earl‚Äôs son. In the mean time his meny (<i>retinue</i>) rob his chamber, and
rifled his hutches, and trussed such as they could get together, and carried
it away on his own horses.‚Äù As soon as this was done, Radford, who was
an eminent lawyer residing at Poghill, near Kyrton, and now aged, was
led forth and brutally murdered. In
the stories and novels of the middle
ages, the favoured lover who has been
admitted secretly into the chamber of
his mistress is often concealed in the
hutch or chest.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 262. A Lady in Bed.</i></p></div>

<p>Our cut <a href="#n262">No. 262</a>, taken from the
same manuscript of the Bible which
furnished our last illustration, represents
the hutch also in its place at the foot
of the bed. This sketch is interesting,
both as showing more distinctly than
the others the rings of the bed-curtains,
and the rods attached to the celure,
and as a particularly good illustration of the habit which still continued
in all classes and ranks of society, of sleeping in bed entirely naked.
The same practice is shown in several of our other cuts (see Nos. 256,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
260, and 261), and, indeed, in all the illuminated manuscripts of the
fifteenth century which contain bedroom scenes. Wherever this is not
the case, there is some evident reason for the contrary, as in our cut
No. 257. During this period we have not so many pictorial illustrations
of the toilet as might be expected. The ladies‚Äô combs were generally
coarse and large in the teeth, but often very elaborately and beautifully
ornamented. The mirror was, as at former periods, merely a circular
piece of metal or glass, set in a case, which was carved with figures or
ornaments externally. The vocabularies mention the mirror as one of
the usual objects with which a chamber should be furnished.</p>

<p>Our cut <a href="#n263">No. 263</a> is taken from a manuscript (MS. Cotton. Tiberius, A.
vii. fol. 93, r<sup>o</sup>) of the English translation of the singular work of the
French writer, Guillaume de Deguilleville, entitled ‚ÄúLe P√©lerinage de la
Vie Humaine,‚Äù a poem which bears a striking resemblance in its general
character to the ‚ÄúPilgrim‚Äôs Progress‚Äù of Bunyan. The English version,
which is in verse, and entitled simply the ‚ÄúPilgrim,‚Äù has been ascribed to
Lydgate. In the course of his adventures, the pilgrim comes to the lady
Agyographe, who is represented as dealing in ‚Äúmercerye,‚Äù but the
enumeration of articles embraced under that term is rather singular:&mdash;

Our cut represents the interior of the house of the lady mercer, with the
various articles enumerated in the text; the boxes of ointment, the horse-combs,
the men‚Äôs combs, and the mirrors. She first offers the pilgrim a

than they really were, which the pilgrim refuses:&mdash;

In the celebrated ‚ÄúRomance of the Rose,‚Äù one of the heroines, Belacueil,

There is a representation of this scene in the beautiful illuminated manuscript
of the ‚ÄúRomance of the Rose‚Äù in the British Museum (MS. Harl.
No. 4425), in which, singularly enough, the mirror itself, which is
evidently of glass, is represented as being convex, though perhaps we must
attribute this appearance to the unskilfulness of the designer, who in his
attempt to show that the mirror was
round, failed in perspective. In our first
cut, from Guillaume de Deguilleville, it
will be observed that the artist, in order
to show that the articles intended to be
represented are mirrors, and not plates, or
any other round implements, has drawn
the reflections of faces, although nobody
is looking into them. Another peculiarity
in the illumination of the ‚ÄúRomance
of the Rose,‚Äù a portion of which
is represented in our cut <a href="#n264">No. 264</a>, is that the mirror is fixed against the
wall, instead of being held in the hand when used, as appears to have
been more generally the case. Standing-mirrors seem not to have been
yet in use; but before the end of the fifteenth century, glass mirrors,
which appear to have been invented in Belgium or Germany, came
into use.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">During</span> the fifteenth century, society in England was going through
a transition which was less visible on the surface than it was great
and effectual at the heart. France and England were both torn by
revolutionary struggles, but with very different results; for while in
France the political power of the middle classes was destroyed, and the
country was delivered to the despotism of the crown and of the great
lords, in our country it was the feudal nobility which was ruined, while
the municipal bodies had obtained an increased importance in the state,
and the landed gentry gained more independence and power from
the decline of that of the great feudal barons. Yet in both countries
feudalism itself, in its real character, was rapidly passing away&mdash;in France,
before the power of the crown; in England, before the remodelling and
reformation of society. While the substance of feudalism was thus
perishing, its outward forms appeared to be more sought than ever, and
the pride and ostentation of rank, and its arrogance too, prevailed during
the fifteenth century to a greater degree than at any previous period.
The court of Burgundy, itself only in origin a feudal principality, had set
itself up as the model of feudalism, and there the old romances of
chivalry were remodelled and published anew, and were read eagerly as
the mirror of feudal doctrines. The court of Burgundy was remarkable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
for its wonderful pomp and magnificence, and for its ostentatious display
of wealth; it was considered the model of lordly courtesy and high
breeding, and was the centre of literature and art; and circumstances
had brought the court of England into intimate connection with it, so
that the influence of Burgundian fashions was greater during this period
in England than that of the fashions of the court of France. There can
be no doubt, too, that the social character in England and in France were
now beginning to diverge widely from each other. The condition of the
lower class in France was becoming more and more miserable, and the
upper classes were becoming more licentious and immoral; whereas, in
England, though serfdom or villanage still existed in name, and in law,
the peasantry had been largely enfranchised, and it was gradually disappearing
as a fact; and their landlords, the country gentry, lived among
them in more kindly and more intimate intercourse, instead of treating
them with tyrannical cruelty, and dragging them off to be slaughtered in
their private wars. Increased commerce had spread wealth among the
middle classes, and had brought with it, no doubt, a considerable increase
of social comfort. Social manners were still very coarse, but it is quite
evident that the efforts of the religious reformers, the Lollards, were
improving the moral tone of society in the middle and lower classes.</p>

<p>People had, moreover, begun now to discuss great social questions.
The example of this had been given in England in the celebrated poem
of ‚ÄúPiers Ploughman,‚Äù in the middle of the fourteenth century, and such
questions were mooted very extensively by the Lollards, who held as a
principle the natural equality of man. This was a doctrine which was
accepted very slowly, and was certainly discountenanced by the Roman
Catholic preachers, who encouraged the belief that the division of society
into distinct classes was a permanent judgment of God, and even invented
legends to account for its origin. Long after feudalism had ceased, it
was difficult to disabuse people of the opinion that the blood which
flowed in the veins of a gentleman was of a different kind from that of
a peasant, or even from that of a burgher. One of the legendary
explanations of these divisions of blood is given by a poetical writer of
the reign of Henry VII., named Alexander Barclay, who has left us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
seven ‚Äúeclogues,‚Äù as he calls them, on the social questions which agitated
men‚Äôs minds in his day. One day, according to this story, while Adam
was absent occupied with his agricultural labours, Eve sat at home on
their threshold, with all her children about her, when suddenly she
became aware of the approach of the Creator, and, ashamed of the great
number of them, and fearful that her productiveness might be misinterpreted,
she hurriedly concealed those which were the least well-favoured.
‚ÄúSome of them she placed under hay, some under straw and chaff,
some in the chimney, and some in a tub of draff; but such as were
fair and well made she wisely and cunningly kept with her.‚Äù God told
her that he had come to see her children, that he might promote them
in their different degrees; upon which she presented them in their order
of birth. God then ordained the eldest to be an emperor, the second to
be a king, and the third a duke to guide an army; of the rest he made
earls, lords, barons, squires, knights, and ‚Äúhardy champions.‚Äù Some he
appointed to be ‚Äújudges, mayors, and governors, merchants, sheriffs, and
protectors, aldermen, and burgesses.‚Äù While all this was going on, Eve
began to think of her other children, and, unwilling that they should lose
their share of honours, she now produced them from their hiding-places.
They appeared with their hair rough, and powdered with chaff, some full
of straws, and some covered with cobwebs and dust, ‚Äúthat anybody might
be frightened at the sight of them.‚Äù They were black with dirt, ill-favoured
in countenance, and mishapen in stature, and God did not
conceal his disgust. ‚ÄúNone,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúcan make a vessel of silver out
of an earthen pitcher, or goodly silk out of a goat‚Äôs fleece, or a bright
sword of a cow‚Äôs tail; neither will I, though I can, make a noble gentleman
out of a vile villain. You shall all be ploughmen and tillers of the
ground, to keep oxen and hogs, to dig and delve, and hedge and dike,
and in this wise shall ye live in endless servitude. Even the townsmen
shall laugh you to scorn; yet some of you shall be allowed to dwell in
cities, and shall be admitted to such occupations as those of makers of
puddings, butchers, cobblers, tinkers, costard-mongers, hostlers, or daubers.‚Äù
Such, the teller of the story informs us, was the beginning of servile
labour.

<p>A song of the fifteenth century, printed in the collection of songs and
carols edited for the Percy Society, the burthen of which is the necessity
of money in all conditions, describes the different ranks and their various
aspirations in the following order: the yeoman who desires to become a
gentleman, the gentleman who seeks to be a squire, the squire who
would be a knight, the lettered man who seeks distinction in the schools,
the merchant who aspired to rise to wealth, and the lawyer who sought
promotion at the bar. In the interesting ‚ÄúRecueil de Po√©sies Fran√ßoises
des xv<sup>e</sup> et xvi<sup>e</sup> si√®cles,‚Äù by M. de Montaiglon (vol. iii. pp. 138, 147),
there are two poems, probably of the latter part of the fifteenth century,
entitled <i>Les Souhaitz des Hommes</i> (the wishes of the men) and <i>Les Souhaitz
des Femmes</i> (the wishes of the women), in which the various classes are made
to declare that which they desire most. Thus dukes, counts, and knights
desire to be skilful in warlike accomplishments; the president in parliament
desires the gold chain and the seat of honour, with wisdom in
giving judgment; the advocate wishes for eloquence in court, and for a
fair bourgeoise or damoiselle at home to make his house joyful; the
burgher wishes for a good fire in winter, and a good supply of fat capons;
and the clergy are made to wish for good cheer and handsome women.
The wishes of the women are on the whole, perhaps, more characteristic
than those of the men. Thus, the queen wishes to be able to love God
and the king, and to live in peace; the duchess, to have all the enjoyments
and pleasures of wealth; the countess, to have a husband who was
loyal and brave; the knight‚Äôs lady, to hunt the stag in the green woods;
the damoiselle, or lady of gentle blood, also loved hunting, and wished
for a husband valiant in war; and the chamber-maiden took pleasure in
walking in the fair fields by the river-side; while the bourgeoise loved
above all things a soft bed at night, with a good pillow, and clean white
sheets. That part of society which now comes chiefly under our notice
had fallen into two classes, that which boasted gentle blood, and the
ungentle, or burgher class, and this was particularly shown among the
ladies, for the bourgeoise sought continually to imitate the gentlewoman,
or <i>damoiselle</i>, who, on her part, looked on these encroachments of the other
with great jealousy. M. de Montaiglon has printed in the collection just
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
quoted (vol. v. p. 5) a short poem entitled, ‚ÄúThe Debate between the
Damoiselle and the Bourgeoise,‚Äù in which the exclusive rights of gentle
blood are strongly claimed and disputed. We have seen the same ambition
of the wives of burghers and yeomen to ape the gentlewoman as far
back as the days of Chaucer, and it now often becomes a subject of
popular satire. Yet we must not forget that this desire to imitate higher
society assisted much in refining the manners of the middle classes.
M. de Montaiglon (vol. ii. p. 18) has printed a short piece in verse of
the latter part of the fifteenth century, entitled the ‚ÄúDoctrinal des Filles,‚Äù
containing the sentiments which teachers sought to implant in the minds
of young ladies, and it will suit England at that time equally with France.
The young ladies are here recommended to be bashful; not to be forward
in falling in love; to pay proper attention to their dress, and to
courteousness in behaviour; and not to be too eager in dancing. From
all that we gather from the writers of the time, the love of dancing
appears at this period to have been carried to a very great degree of
extravagance, and to have often led to great dissoluteness in social manners,
and the more zealous moralists preached against the dance with much
earnestness. The author of our ‚ÄúDoctrinal‚Äù admonishes the young
unmarried girl to dance with moderation when she is at the ‚Äúcarol‚Äù (the
name of the ordinary dance), lest people who see her dancing too eagerly
should take her for a dissolute woman&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Fille, quant serez en karolle,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dansez gentiment par mesure,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Car, quant fille se desmesure,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tel la voit qui la tient pour folle.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The young lady is next cautioned against talking scandal, against
believing in dreams, against drinking too much wine, and against being
too talkative at table. She was to avoid idleness, to respect the aged,
not to allow herself to be kissed in secret (kissing in public was the
ordinary form of salutation), and not to be quarrelsome. She was
especially to avoid being alone with a priest, except at confession, for
it was dangerous to let priests haunt the house where there were young
females&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Fille, hormis confession,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Seullette ne parlez √† prebstre;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Laissez-les en leur eglise estre,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sans ce qu‚Äôilz hantent vos maisons.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

These lines, written and published in a bigoted Roman Catholic country,
by a man who was evidently a staunch Romanist, and addressed to young
women as their rule of behaviour, present perhaps one of the strongest
evidences we could have of the evil influence exercised by the Romish
clergy on social morals, a fact, however, of which there are innumerable
other proofs.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the effect of such teaching on the better
educated classes, the general character of the women of the middle and
lower classes appears to have been of a description little likely to be conducive
to domestic happiness. All the popular materials for social history
represent their morals as being very low, and their tempers as overbearing
and quarrelsome, the consequence of which was a separation of domestic
life among the two sexes after marriage, the husbands, when not engaged
at their work or business, seeking their amusement away from the house,
and the wives assembling with their ‚Äúgossips,‚Äù often at the public taverns,
to drink and amuse themselves. In the old mysteries and morality plays,
in which there was a good deal of quiet satire on the manners of the age
in which they were composed and acted, Noah‚Äôs wife appears often as
the type of the married woman in the burgher class, and her temper
seems to have become almost proverbial. In the ‚ÄúTowneley Mysteries,‚Äù
when Noah acquaints his wife with the approach of the threatened
deluge, and of his orders to build the ark, she abuses him so grossly as a
common carrier of ill news, that he is provoked to strike her; she returns
the blow, and they have a regular battle, in which the husband has the
advantage, but he is glad to escape from her tongue, and proceed to his
work. In the ‚ÄúChester Mysteries,‚Äù Noah‚Äôs wife will not go into the
ark; and when all is ready, the flood beginning, and the necessity of
taking her in apparent, she refuses to enter, unless she is allowed to take
her gossips with her:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Yea, sir, sette up youer saile,</i><br /></span>

</span></span>

It is to be supposed that Noah, when he wanted her, had found her with
her gossips in the tavern. At last, Noah‚Äôs three sons are obliged to drag
their mother into the ‚Äúboat,‚Äù when a scene occurs which appears thus
briefly indicated in the text,&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>Ha, ha! marye, this is hotte!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>It is good for to be still.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The conversation of these ‚Äúgossips,‚Äù when they met, was loose and coarse
in the extreme, and, as described in contemporary writings, the practice
even of profane swearing prevailed generally among both sexes to a degree
which, to our ears, would sound perfectly frightful&mdash;it was one of the
vices against which the moralists preached most bitterly. Life, indeed, in
spite of its occasional refinement in the higher ranks of society, was
essentially coarse at this period, and we can hardly conceive much delicacy
of people who dieted as, for instance, the family of the earl of Northumberland
are reported to have done in the household book, compiled in
1512, which was published by bishop Percy. I only give the breakfast
allowances, which, on flesh-days, were ‚Äúfor my lord and my lady,‚Äù a loaf
of bread ‚Äúin trenchers,‚Äù two manchets (loaves of fine meal), one quart of
beer (or, as we should now call it, ale), a quart of wine, half a chine
of mutton, or a chine of beef boiled; for ‚Äúmy lord Percy and Mr. Thomas
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
Percy‚Äù (the two elder children), half a loaf of household bread, a manchet,
one pottle of beer (two quarts&mdash;they were not yet allowed wine), a
chicken, or else three mutton bones boiled; ‚Äúbreakfasts for the nurcery,
for my lady Margaret and Mr. Ingram Percy‚Äù (who in fact were mere
children), a manchet, one quart of beer, and three mutton bones boiled;
for my lady‚Äôs gentlewomen, a loaf of household bread, a pottle of beer,
and three mutton bones boiled, or else a piece of beef boiled. It will be
seen here that the family dined two to a plate, or mess, as was the usual
custom in the middle ages. On fish-days, the breakfast allowances were
as follows: for my lord and my lady, a loaf of bread in trenchers, two
manchets, a quart of beer, a quart of wine, two pieces of salt fish, six
baked herrings, or a dish of sprats; for the two elder sons, half a loaf of
household bread, a manchet, a pottle of beer, a dish of butter, a piece of
salt fish, a dish of sprats, or three white (fresh) herrings; for the two
children in the nursery, a manchet, a quart of beer, a dish of butter, a
piece of salt fish, a dish of sprats, or three white herrings; and for my
lady‚Äôs gentlewomen, a loaf of bread, a pottle of beer, a piece of salt fish,
or three white herrings. We shall be inclined, in comparing it with our
modern style of living, to consider this as a very substantial meal to begin
the day with.</p>

<p>According to the old moral and satirical writers, excessive greediness
in eating had become one of the prevailing vices of this age. Barclay, in
his ‚ÄúEclogues,‚Äù gives a strange picture of the bad regulations of the
tables at the courts of great people, in the time of Henry VII. He
describes the tables as served in great confusion, and even as covered with
dirty table-cloths. The food he represents as being bad in itself, and
often ill-cooked. Everybody, he says, was obliged to eat in a hurry,
unless he would lose his chance of eating at all, and they served the worst
dishes first, so that when you had satiated yourself with food which was
hardly palatable, the dainties made their appearance. This led people to
eat more than they wanted. When an attractive dish did make its
appearance, it led literally to a scramble among the guests:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>But if it fortune, as seldome doth befall,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That at beginning come dishes best of all,</i><br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or</i> (before) <i>thou hast tasted a morsell or twayne,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Thy dish out of sight is taken soon agayne.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Slowe be the servers in serving in alway,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But swifte be they after taking thy meate away.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A speciall custome is used them among,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>No good dish to suffer on borde to be longe.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>If the dish be pleasaunt, eyther fleshe or fishe,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ten handes at once swarme in the dishe;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And if it be fleshe, ten knives shalt thou see</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Mangling the flesh and in the platter flee;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To put there thy handes is perill without fayle,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Without a gauntlet or els a glove of mayle.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

It would thus seem that the servers left the guests, except those at the
high table, to help themselves. It appears that in the earlier part of the
sixteenth century, the English had gained the character of keeping
the most profuse tables, and being the greatest eaters, in Europe. A scrap
preserved in a manuscript of the reign of Henry VIII., and printed in the
‚ÄúReliqui√¶ Antiqu√¶‚Äù (vol. i. p. 326), offers rather a curious excuse for
this character. There was a merchant of England, we are told, who
adventured into far countries, and when he had been there a month or
more, a great lord invited this English merchant to dinner. And when they
were at dinner, the lord wondered that he eat not more of his meat, for,
said he, ‚ÄúEnglishmen are called the greatest feeders in the world, and it
is reported that one man will eat as much as six of another nation, and
more victuals are consumed there than in any other region.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is
true,‚Äù the merchant replied, ‚Äúit is so, and for three reasonable causes so
much victual is served on the table; one of which is, for love, another,
for physic, and the third, for dread. Sir, as concerns the first, we are
accustomed to have many divers meats for our friends and kinsfolk,
because some love one manner of meat, and some another, and we wish
every man to be satisfied. Secondly, in regard of physic, because for
divers maladies which people have, some men will eat one meat, and
some another, it is desirable that everybody should be suited. The third
cause is for dread; for we have so great abundance and plenty in our
realm, of beasts and fowls, that if we should not kill and destroy them,
they would destroy and devour us.‚Äù It may be remarked that, during
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
this period, the English merchants and burghers in general seem to have
kept very good tables, and that the lower orders, and even the peasantry,
appear to have been by no means ill fed.</p>

<p>The confusion in serving at table described by Alexander Barclay was
no doubt caused in a great measure by the numerous troops of riotous and
unruly serving men and followers, who were kept by the noblemen and
greater land-holders, and who formed everywhere one of the curses of
society. Within the household, they had become so unmanageable that
their masters made vain attempts to regulate them; while abroad they
were continually engaged in quarrels, often sanguinary ones, with countrymen
or townsmen, or with the retainers of other noblemen or gentlemen,
in which their masters considered that it concerned their credit to
support and protect them, so that the quarrels of the servants became
sometimes feuds between their lords. The old writers, of all descriptions,
bear witness to the bad conduct of serving men and servants in general,
and to their riotousness, and especially of the <i>gar√ßons</i>, or, as they were
called in English, ‚Äúlads.‚Äù Cain‚Äôs <i>garcio</i>, in the ‚ÄúTowneley Mysteries,‚Äù was
intended as a picture of this class, in all their coarseness and vulgarity;
and the character of Jak Garcio, in the play of ‚ÄúThe Shepherds,‚Äù in the
same collection, is another type of them.</p>

<p>We have seen that the breakfast in the household of the Percys was a
very substantial meal, but it seems not to have been generally considered
a regular meal, either as to what was eaten at it, or as to the hour at
which it was taken. Perhaps this was left to the convenience, or caprice,
of individuals.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> We have a curious description of the division of the occupations
of the day in a princely household, in an account which has been
left us of the household regulations of the duchess of York, mother of
king Edward IV., which, however, were strongly influenced by the pious
character of that princess, who spent much time in religious duties and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
observances. Her usual hour of rising was seven o‚Äôclock, when she heard
matins; she then ‚Äúmade herself ready,‚Äù or dressed herself, for the occupations
of the day, and when this was done, she had a low mass in her
chamber. After this mass, she took something ‚Äúto recreate nature,‚Äù
which was, in fact, her breakfast, though it is afterwards stated that it
was not a regular meal. She then went to chapel, and remained at
religious service until dinner, which, as we are further told, took place,
‚Äúupon eating days,‚Äù at eleven o‚Äôclock, with a first dinner in the time of
high mass for the various officers whose duty it was to attend at table;
but, on fasting days, the dinner hour was twelve o‚Äôclock, with a later
dinner for carvers and waiters. After dinner, the princess devoted an
hour to give audience to all who had any business with her; she then
slept for a quarter of an hour, and then spent her time in prayer until the
first peal of even-song (vespers), when ‚Äúshe drank wine or ale at her
pleasure.‚Äù She went to chapel, and returned thence to supper, which, on
eating days, was served at five o‚Äôclock, the carvers and servers at table
having supped at four. The ordinary diet in the house of this princess
appears to have been extremely simple. On Sunday, Tuesday, and
Thursday, the household was served at dinner with beef and mutton, and
one roast; at supper with ‚Äúleyched‚Äù beef and roast mutton; on Monday
and Wednesday, they had boiled beef and mutton at dinner, and at supper,
the same as on the three other days; on Friday, salt fish and two dishes
of fresh fish; and on Saturday, salt fish, one fresh fish, and butter, for
dinner, and salt fish and eggs for supper. After supper, the princess
‚Äúdisposed herself to be familiar with her gentlewomen,‚Äù with ‚Äúhonest
mirth;‚Äù and one hour before going to bed she took a cup of wine, went
to her privy closet to pray, and was in bed by eight o‚Äôclock.</p>

<p>The duchess of York is of course to be looked upon as a model of
piety and sobriety, and her hours are not perhaps to be taken as exactly
those of other people, and certainly not her occupations. In the
French ‚ÄúD√©bat de la Damoiselle et de la Bourgeoise,‚Äù the latter
accuses the gentlewoman of late rising. ‚ÄúBefore you are awake,‚Äù she
says, ‚ÄúI am dressed and have attended to my duties; do not therefore
be surprised if we are more diligent than you, since you sleep till dinner-time.‚Äù
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù replies the damoiselle, ‚Äúwe must spend our evening in
dancing, and cannot do as you, who go to bed at the same time as your
hens.‚Äù</p>

<p>It has been stated already that, even in the highest ranks of society,
the ladies were usually employed at home on useful, and often on profitable
work. This work embraced the various processes in the manufacture
of linen and cloth, as well as the making it up into articles of dress, and
embroidery, netting, and other similar occupations. The spinning-wheel
was a necessary implement in every household, from the palace to the
cottage. In 1437, John Notyngham, a rich grocer of Bury St. Edmunds,
bequeathed to one of his legatees, ‚Äúj spynnyng whel et j par carpsarum,‚Äù
meaning probably ‚Äúa pair of cards,‚Äù an implement which is stated in the
‚ÄúPromptorium Parvulorum‚Äù to be especially a ‚Äúwommanys instrument.‚Äù
A few years previously, in 1418, Agnes Stubbard, a resident in the same
town, bequeathed to two of her maids, each,
one pair of wool-combs, one ‚Äúkembyng-stok‚Äù
(a combing-stock, or machine for holding the
wool to be combed), one wheel, and one pair
of cards; and to another woman a pair of
wool-combs, a wheel, and a pair of cards.
John Baret, of Bury, in 1463, evidently a rich
man with a very large house and household,
speaks in his will of a part of the house, or
probably a room, which was distinguished as
the ‚Äúspinning house.‚Äù Our cut <a href="#n265">No. 265</a>,
from an illuminated Bible of the fifteenth
century in the Imperial Library at Paris (No. 6829), represents a woman
of apparently an ordinary class of society at work with her distaff under
her arm. The next cut (<a href="#n266">No. 266</a>) is taken from a fine illuminated manuscript
of the well-known French ‚ÄúBoccace des Nobles Femmes,‚Äù and
illustrates the story of ‚ÄúCyrille,‚Äù the wife of king Tarquin. We have
here a queen and her maidens employed in the same kind of domestic
labours. The lady on the left is occupied with her combs, or cards, and
her combing-stock; the other sits at her distaff, also supported by a stock,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
instead of holding it under her arm; and the queen, with her hand on
the shuttle, is performing the final operation of weaving.</p>

<p>Some of the more elegant female accomplishments, which were
unknown in the earlier ages, were now coming into vogue. Dancing
was, as already stated, a more favourite amusement than ever, and it
received a new <i>√©clat</i> from the frequent introduction of new dances, of
which some of the old popular writers give us long lists. Some of these,
too, were of a far more active and exciting description than formerly.

<p>Music, also, was more extensively cultivated as a domestic accomplishment;
and it was a more common thing to meet with ladies who indulged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
in literary pursuits. Sometimes, too, the ladies of the fifteenth century
practised drawing and painting,&mdash;arts which, instead of being, as formerly,
restricted almost to the clergy, had now passed into the hands of the laity,
and were undergoing rapid improvement. The illuminated manuscript
of ‚ÄúBoccace des Nobles Femmes,‚Äù which furnished the subject of our
last cut, contains several pictures of ladies occupied in painting, one of
which (illustrating the chapter on ‚ÄúMarcie Vierge‚Äù) is represented in
our cut <a href="#n267">No. 267</a>. The lady has her palette, her colour-box, and her
stone for grinding the colours, much as an artist of the present day would
have, though she is seated before a somewhat singularly formed framework.
She is evidently painting her own portrait, for which purpose she
uses the mirror which hangs over the colour-box. It is rather curious
that the tools which lie by the side of the grinding-stone are those of a
sculptor, and not those of a painter, so that it was no doubt intended we
should suppose that she combined the two branches of the art. In one of
the illuminations of the manuscript of the ‚ÄúRomance of the Rose,‚Äù
which has been quoted before, preserved in the British Museum, we have
a picture of a male painter, copied in our cut <a href="#n268">No. 268</a>, and intended to
represent Apelles, who is working with a palette and easel, exactly as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
artists do at the present day: both he and our lady artist in the cut are
evidently painting on board. We begin now also to trace the existence
of a great number of domestic sports and pastimes, some of which still
remain in usage, but which we have not here room to enumerate.</p>

<p>Out of doors, the garden continued to be the favourite resort of the
ladies. It would be easy to pick out numerous descriptions of gardens
from the writers of the fifteenth century. Lydgate thus describes the
garden of the rich ‚Äúchurl:‚Äù&mdash;

</span></span>

And at a somewhat later period, Stephen Hawes, in his singular poem
entitled ‚ÄúThe Pastime of Pleasure,‚Äù describes a larger and more magnificent
garden. Amour arrives at the gate of the garden of La Bel Pucel,
and requests the portress to conduct him to her mistress&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>From the description of this ‚Äúgloryous‚Äù garden that follows, we might
imagine that the practice of cutting or training trees and flowers into
fantastic shapes, as was done with box-trees in the last century, had prevailed
among the gardeners of the fifteenth. The garden of La Bel
Pucel is described as being&mdash;</p>

<p>I have had occasion before to observe that garlands and chaplets of
flowers were in great request in the middle ages, and the making of them
was a favourite occupation. Our cut <a href="#n269">No. 269</a>, taken from the illuminated
calendar prefixed to the splendid manuscript ‚ÄúHeures‚Äù of Anne of
Brittany in the Imperial Library in Paris, where it illustrates the month
of May, represents the interior of a garden, with a lady thus employed
with her maidens. This garden appears to be a square piece of ground,
surrounded by a high wall, with a central compartment or lawn enclosed
by a fence of trellis-work and a hedge of rose trees. Pictures of gardens
will also be found in the MS. of the ‚ÄúRomance of the Rose‚Äù already
referred to, and in other illuminated books, but the illuminators were
unable to represent the elaborate descriptions of the poets. Besides
flowers, every garden contained herbs for medicinal and other purposes,
such as love-philtars, which were in great repute in the middle ages. In
the romance of ‚ÄúGerard de Nevers‚Äù (or La Violette), an old woman
goes into the garden attached to the castle where she lives, to gather
herbs for making a deadly poison. This incident is represented in our
cut <a href="#n270">No. 270</a>, taken from a magnificent illuminated manuscript of the
prose version of this romance in the Imperial Library in Paris. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
garden is here again surrounded by a wall, with a postern gate leading to
the country, and we have the same trellis fencings as before. It appears
to have been the usual custom thus to enclose and protect the beds in a
garden with a trellis fence.</p>

<p>The various games and exercises practised by people out of doors seem
to have differed little at this time from those belonging to former periods,
except that from time to time we meet with allusions to kinds of amusement
which have not before been mentioned, although they were probably
well known. Among the drawings of the borders of illuminated
manuscripts, from the thirteenth century to the beginning of the sixteenth,
we meet with groups of children and of adults, which represent, doubtless,
games of which both the names and the explanations are lost; and sometimes
we are surprised to find thus represented games which otherwise we
should have supposed to be of modern invention. One very curious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
instance may be stated. In the now rather celebrated manuscript of the
French romance of ‚ÄúAlexander,‚Äù in the Bodleian Library at Oxford,
which was written and illuminated in the fourteenth century, we have
representations of a puppet show, which appears to be identical with our
modern Punch and Judy. We copy one of these curious early drawings
in our cut <a href="#n271">No. 271</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n271" src="images/i_n271.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 271. A Puppet Show.</i></p></div>

<p>Among the pastimes most popular at this time with the lower
and middle classes were archery, the practice of which was enforced by
authority, and shooting with the crossbow, as well as most of the ordinary
rough games known at a later period, such as football and the like. The
English archers were celebrated throughout Europe. The poet Barclay,
who wrote at the close of the century, makes the shepherd in one of his
eclogues not only boast of his skill in archery, but he adds&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Bull-baiting, bear-baiting, and such like sports, were also pursued
with avidity; and even gentlemen and young noblemen took part in
them. Any game, in fact, which produced violent exercise and violent
excitement was in favour with all ranks. Among the higher classes,
hunting and hawking were pursued with more eagerness than ever, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
they become now the subjects of numerous written treatises, setting
forth their laws and regulations. When gentlemen were riding out
for pleasure, they were usually accompanied with hawks and hounds.
In the annexed cut (<a href="#n272">No. 272</a>), taken from an illuminated manuscript
of the French Boccaccio at Paris (Imperial Library, MS. No. 6887),
a party thus attended meets another party on horseback, and they are
in the act of saluting each other. Horses were still almost the only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
conveyance from place to place, though we now more often meet
with pictures of carriages; but, though evidently intended to be very
gorgeous, they are of clumsy construction, and seem only to have
been used by princes or great nobles. I give two examples from a
superbly illuminated manuscript of the French translation of ‚ÄúValerius
Maximus,‚Äù in the great national library in Paris (No. 6984), executed in
the latter part of the fifteenth century. The first (cut <a href="#n273">No. 273</a>) is a royal
car, in which a throne has been placed for the king, who sits in it in state.
His guards lead the horses. The form of the carriage is very simple; it
is a mere cart on wheels, without any springs, and has a covering supported
on two large hoops, which are strengthened by cross-bars resembling
the spokes of a wheel. In the second example (cut <a href="#n274">No. 274</a>), the carriage
bears some resemblance to a modern omnibus. It is intended to
represent the incident in Roman history, where the unfilial Tullia caused
her charioteer to drive over the body of her father, Servius Tullus, who
had been slain by her husband Tarquin the Proud. The ladies appear to
sit on benches inside the carriage, while the driver is mounted on the
horse nearest to it. These carriages still retained the name of carts,
although they appear to have been used chiefly on state occasions. Riding
in them must have been very uneasy, and they were exposed to accidents.
When Richard II. made his grand entry into London, a ceremony
described by Richard de Maidstone in Latin verse, the ladies of the court
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
rode in two cars, or carts, one of which fell over, and exposed its fair
occupants in a not very decorous manner to the jeers of the multitude.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 274. Tullia Riding over her Father‚Äôs Body.</i></p></div>

<p>As yet carriages seem not to have been used in travelling, which was
performed on horseback or on foot. During the century of which we are
speaking, especially after the accession of Henry VI. to the English
throne, the roads were extremely insecure, the country being infested by
such numerous bands of robbers that it was necessary to travel in considerable
companies, and well armed. From this circumstance, and from
the political condition of the age, the retinue of the nobility and gentry
presented a very formidable appearance; and such as could only afford to
travel with one or two servants generally attached themselves to some
powerful neighbour, and contrived to make their occasions of locomotion
coincide with his. We find several allusions to the dangers of travelling
in the Paston Letters. In a letter dated in 1455 or 1460 (it is uncertain
which), Margaret Paston desires her husband, then in London, to pay a
debt for one of their friends, because, on account of the robbers who
beset the road, money could not be sent safely from Norfolk to the
capital. A year or two earlier, we hear
of a knight of Suffolk riding with a
hundred horsemen, armed defensively and
offensively, besides the accompaniment
of friends. As travelling, however, became
frequent, it led to the multiplication
of places of entertainment on the roads,
and large hostelries and inns were now
scattered pretty thickly over the country,
not only in all the smaller towns, but
often in villages, and sometimes even in
comparatively lonely places. In the
manuscript of the French Boccaccio in the Imperial Library (No. 6887),
there is a picture (copied in our cut <a href="#n275">No. 275</a>) representing a publican
serving his liquor on a bench outside his door.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img id="n275" src="images/i_n275.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 275. A Publican.</i></p></div>

<p>The tavern was the general lounge of the idle, and even of the
industrious, during their hours of relaxation; and in the towns a good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
part of the male population who had not domestic establishments of their
own appear to have lived at the taverns and eating-houses, the allurements
of which drew them into every sort of dissipation, which ended in
the ruin of men‚Äôs fortunes and health. The poet Occleve, in his
reminiscences of his own conduct, describes the life of the riotous young
men of his time. The sign which hung at the tavern door, he says, was
always a temptation to him, which he could seldom resist. The tavern
was the resort of women of light character, and was the scene of brawls
and outrages; by the former of which he was frequently seduced into
extravagant expenditure, but his want of courage, he confesses, kept him
out of the latter. Westminster gate was then celebrated for its taverns
and cooks‚Äô shops, at which the poet Occleve‚Äôs lavishness made him a
welcome guest:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

</span></span>

Here he spent his nights in such a manner that he went to bed later
than any of his companions, except perhaps two, whose time of going to
bed he says that he did not know, it was so late, but he asserts that they
loved their beds so well that they never left them till near prime, or six
o‚Äôclock in the morning, which thus appears, at the beginning of the
fifteenth century, to have been considered an excessively late hour for
rising.</p>

<p>The tavern was also the resort of women of the middle and lower
orders, who assembled there to drink, and to gossip. It has been already
stated that, in the mysteries, or religious plays, Noah was represented as
finding his wife drinking with her gossips at the tavern when he wanted
to take her into the ark. The meetings of gossips in taverns form the
subjects of many of the popular songs of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries, both in England and France. It appears that these meetings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
of gossips in taverns were the first examples of what we now call a
pic-nic, for each woman took with her some provisions, and with these
the whole party made a feast in common. A song of perhaps the middle
of the fifteenth century, printed in my collection of ‚ÄúSongs and Carols,‚Äù
edited for the Percy Society, gives us rather a picturesque description of
one of these gossip-meetings. The women, having met accidentally, the
question is put where the best wine was to be had, and one of them
replies that she knows where could be procured the best drink in the
town, but that she did not wish her husband to be acquainted with it:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>I know a drawght of mery-go-downe,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The best it is in all thys towne;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But yet wold I not, for my gowne,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My husbond it wyst, ye may me trust.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The place of meeting having thus been fixed, they are represented as
proceeding thither two and two, not to attract observation, lest their
husbands might hear of their meeting. ‚ÄúGod might send me a stripe or
two,‚Äù said one, ‚Äúif my husband should see me here.‚Äù ‚ÄúNay,‚Äù said
Alice, another, ‚Äúshe that is afraid had better go home; I dread no man.‚Äù
Each was to carry with her some goose, or pork, or the wing of a capon,
or pigeon pie, or some similar article&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>And ich</i> (each) <i>off them wyll sumwhat bryng,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Gosse, pygge, or capons wyng,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Past√©s off pigeons, or sum other thyng</i>.<br /></span>
</span></span>

Accordingly, on arriving at the tavern, they call for wine ‚Äúof the best,‚Äù
and then

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ech off them brought forth ther dysch;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sum brought flesh, and sume fysh.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

Their conversation runs first on the goodness of the wines, and next on
the behaviour of their husbands, with whom they are all dissatisfied. In
one copy of the song, a harper makes his appearance, whom they hire,
and dance to his music. When they pay their reckoning, they find, in
one copy of the song, that it amounts to threepence each, and rejoice
that it is so little, while in another they find that each has to pay sixpence,
and are alarmed at the greatness of the amount. They agree to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
separate, and go home by different streets, and they are represented as
telling their husbands that they had been to church. This is no doubt
a picture of a common scene in the fifteenth century. Among the
municipal records of Canterbury, there is preserved the deposition of a
man who appears to have been suspected of a robbery, and who, to prove
an alibi, describes all his actions during three days. On one of these,
Monday, he went after eight o‚Äôclock in the evening to a tavern, and
there he found ‚Äúwyfes‚Äù drinking, ‚Äúthat is to say, Goddardes wyfe, Cornewelles
wyfe, and another woman,‚Äù and he had a halfpennyworth of beer
with them. This was apparently at the beginning of the reign of
Henry VIII.</p>

<p>It has been intimated before, that literature and reading had now
become more general accomplishments than formerly. We can trace
among the records of social history a general
spreading of education, which showed an
increasing intellectual agitation; in fact,
education, without becoming more perfect,
had become more general. I have already
given figures of the implements of writing
at an earlier period. In one of the compartments
of the tapestry of ‚ÄúNancy‚Äù (of
the latter part of this century), engravings
of which have been published by M. Achille
Jubinal, we have a figure of a scribe (cut
No. 276) with all his apparatus of writing,&mdash;the
pen, the penknife, and the portable
pen-case with ink-stand attached. But the
most curious article which this scribe has
in use is a pair of <i>spectacles</i>. Spectacles, however, we know had been in
existence long before this period. A century earlier, Chaucer‚Äôs ‚ÄúWife of
Bath‚Äù observed rather sententiously:&mdash;

ivory, with the combe, and a payre spectacles of sylvir and ovir-gilt.‚Äù
This shows that already in the middle of the fifteenth century, a pair of
spectacles was not an uncommon article.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> Reformation brought with it, or at all events it was coeval with,
a general revolution in society. Although the nobility still kept up
much of their ancient state, feudalism was destroyed during the reigns of
the first two Tudors, while the lower and middle classes of the population
were rising in condition and in the consciousness of their own importance,
and with this rise came an increase of domestic comforts and social
development. It was on the ruins of the monastic property, confiscated
by Henry VIII., that the English gentlemen gained their highest position,
and, by their independence of the old aristocracy, they assisted in finally
breaking its power, and thus gave a new character to English society,
which at the same time was experiencing influences that came successively
from without. Till the reign of Elizabeth, and after her accession
to the throne, there was a close connection with the Netherlands and
Germany, and we imported most of our novelties and fashions from our
Protestant neighbours on the continent; whilst, from Elizabeth‚Äôs reign
onwards, and with little intermission to the present time, France has
been our principal model for imitation. This is a point which is the
more necessary to be observed in treating of this subject, because during
the period between the Reformation and the Commonwealth, the art of
engraving in this country had been carried to little perfection, and was
comparatively rarely practised, and we are obliged to look for our pictorial
illustrations of manners to the works of foreign artists.

<p class="caption"><i>No. 277. Houses in the Streets of a Town, Fifteenth Century.</i></p></div>

<p>In towns, domestic architecture experienced no great change in the
course of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Small narrow streets,
with buildings chiefly of the class we term half-timber houses&mdash;the best
of which had their lower story of stone, while those above, each projecting
beyond the one below it, consisted of a timber framework filled up with
bricks&mdash;occupied the greater part of the town, and gave it a compact
appearance which was quite inconsistent with our modern notions of
sanitary arrangement. In the interior the rooms were generally small
and dark, but domestic comfort seems not to have been so much overlooked
as we are in the habit of supposing. Our cut <a href="#n277">No. 277</a>, taken
from an engraving in the English edition of Barclay‚Äôs ‚ÄúShip of Fools,‚Äù
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
1570, gives us a good representation of the general appearance of houses
in a town at that period. In the country a greater change had taken
place in all but the houses of the peasantry. The older castles had
become obsolete, and, with the increasing power and efficiency of the
laws, it was no longer necessary to consult strength before convenience.
The houses of the gentry were, however, still built of considerable extent,
and during the sixteenth century the older domestic arrangements were
only slightly modified. Now, however, instead of seeking a strong
position, people chose situations that were agreeable and healthful, where
they might be protected from inclemency of weather, and where gardens
and orchards might be planted advantageously. Thus, like the earlier
monastic edifices, a gentleman‚Äôs house was built more frequently on low
ground than on a hill.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n278" src="images/i_n278.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 278. The ‚ÄúHundred Men‚Äôs Hall,‚Äù at St. Cross, near Winchester.</i></p></div>

<p>In the sixteenth century, the hall continued to hold its position as the
great public apartment of the house, and in its arrangements it still
differed little from those of an earlier date; it was indeed now the only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
part of the house which had not been affected by the increasing taste for
domestic privacy. We have many examples of the old Gothic hall in
this country, not only as it existed and was used in the sixteenth century,
but, in some cases, especially in colleges, still used for its original purposes.
One of the simplest, and at the same time best, examples is found in the
Hospital of St. Cross, near Winchester, and a sketch of the interior, as
represented in our cut <a href="#n278">No. 278</a>, will serve to give a general notion of the
arrangements of this part of the mansion in former days. As the hall was
frequently the scene of festivities of every description, a gallery for the
musicians was considered one of its necessary appendages. In some cases,
as at Madresfield in Worcestershire, a gallery ran round two or more sides
of the hall; but generally the music gallery occupied one end of the hall,
opposite the dais. Under it was a passage, separated from the hall by a
wooden screen, usually of panel-work, and having on the opposite side the
kitchen and buttery. In the large halls, the fireplace still frequently occupied
the centre of the hall, where there was a small, low platform of stone.
This is distinctly seen in the preceding view of the interior of the hall of
St. Cross. In our cut <a href="#n279">No. 279</a> we give another example of this kind of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
fireplace, from the hall at Penshurst in Kent, where it is still occupied by
the iron dogs, or andirons, that supported the fuel. It may be observed
that these latter, in the north of England and in some other parts, were
called cobirons.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n279" src="images/i_n279.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 279. Fireplace in the Great Hall at Penshurst, Kent.</i></p></div>

<p>The implements attached to the fireplace had hitherto been few in
number, and simple in character, but they now became more numerous.
In the inventories previous to the sixteenth century they are seldom
mentioned at all, and the glossaries speak only of tongs and bellows.
In the will of John Baret of Bury, made in 1463, ‚Äúa payre of tongys
and a payre belwys‚Äù are mentioned. John Hedge, a large householder
of the same town in 1504, speaks of ‚Äúspytts, rakks, cobernys, aundernnys,
trevettes, tongs, with all other iryn werkes moveabyll within my house
longying.‚Äù This would seem to show that cobirons and andirons were
not identical, and it has been supposed that the former denomination
belonged more particularly to the rests for supporting the spit. The
schoolmaster of Bury, in 1552, bequeathed to his hostess, ‚Äúmy cobbornes,
the fire pany (? <i>pan</i>), and the tonges.‚Äù If we turn to the north, we find
in the collection of wills published by the Surtees Society a more frequent
enumeration of the fire implements. William Blakeson, prebendary
of Durham, possessed in 1549 only ‚Äúa payre of cobyrons and one
payre of tongys.‚Äù In 1551, William Lawson, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, had
in his hall ‚Äúone yryn chymney, and a poor, with one paire of tonges,‚Äù
which are valued at the rather high sum of thirty shillings. This is the
first mention of the iron chimney, or grate, but it occurs continually after
the middle of the sixteenth century. In 1557, the ‚Äúiron chymney‚Äù of
the parish clerk of St. Andrew‚Äôs in Newcastle was valued at twenty
shillings. The fire implements in the hall of the farm-house at West
Runcton near Northallerton, in 1562, were ‚Äúj. cryssett, ij. rachyncrokes,
j. pair of tonges, one paire off cobyrons, j. speitt, one paire off potes.‚Äù
We find the cresset frequently included among the implements attached
to the fireplace. The racking-crook was the pothook. In 1564, John
Bynley, minor canon of Durham, had in his hall ‚Äúone iron chimney,
with a bake (<i>back</i>), porre (a <i>por</i>, or <i>poker</i>), tongs, fier shoel (<i>fire shovel</i>),
spette (<i>spit</i>), and a littell rake pertening thereto.‚Äù The fire-irons in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
hall of Margaret Cottam, widow, of Gateshead, in 1564, were ‚Äúone iron
chimney, one porr, one payre of toynges, gibcrokes, rakincroke, and
racks.‚Äù The gibcrokes was probably a sort of pothook or jack. Nearly
the same list of articles occurs frequently in subsequent inventories. In
1567, a housekeeper of Durham had among other such articles ‚Äúa
gallous (<i>gallows</i>) of iron with iiij. crocks.‚Äù The gallows was, of course,
the cross-bar of iron, which projected across the chimney, and from
which the crooks or chains with hooks at the end for sustaining pots were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
suspended; as the gallows turned upon hinges, the pot could be moved
over the sire, or from it, at pleasure, without being taken from the hook,
and as the crooks, of which there were usually more than one, were of
different lengths, the pot might be placed lower to the fire or higher
from it, at will. From the character of some of these adjuncts to the
fireplace, it is evident that the hall fire was frequently used for cooking.
The sixteenth century was the period at which ornamentation was carried
to a very high degree in every description of household utensil, and to
judge from the valuation of some of these articles in the inventories,
they were no doubt of elegant or elaborate work. Numerous examples
of ornamental ironwork, specially applied to fire-dogs or andirons, will
be found in Mr. M. A. Lower‚Äôs interesting paper on the ironworks of
Sussex; and many others, still more elaborate, are preserved in some of
our old gentlemen‚Äôs houses in different parts of the country; but this
ornamentation was carried to a far higher degree in the great manufactories
on the continent, from whence our countrymen in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries obtained a large portion of their richer furniture.
The figure in the middle of the group of fire-irons represented in
our cut <a href="#n280">No. 280</a>, is an example of a fire-dog of this elaborate description,
preserved in the collection of count Brancaleoni,
in Paris, whence also the other
articles in the cut are taken. Most of
them explain themselves; the implement
to the right is a somewhat singularly
formed pair of tongs; that immediately
beneath the fire-dog is an instrument
for moving the logs of wood which then
served as fuel. As a further example of
the remarkable manner in which almost
every domestic article was at this period
adorned, we may point out a box-iron,
for ironing linen, &amp;c. (cut <a href="#n281">No. 281</a>), which is also preserved in one of the
French collections; such an article was of course not made to be
exposed to the action of the fire, and this circumstance gave rise to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
contrivance of forming it into a box, with a separate iron which was to
be heated and placed inside.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 282. Fireplace and Pothook.</i></p></div>

<p>The fire-irons, as we find them enumerated in writings or pictured in
engravings, appear to have formed the same list, or nearly so, though of
course differing in form and ornament according to the varying fashions
of the day, until at a considerably later period they were reduced to the
modern trio of shovel, poker, and tongs. The single pothook, with a
contrivance for lengthening it and shortening it, is shown in our cut
No. 282, taken from one of the remarkable wood engravings in ‚ÄúDer
Weiss Kunig,‚Äù&mdash;a series of prints illustrative of the youthful life of
Maximilian I. of Germany, who ascended the imperial throne in 1493.
The engravings are of the sixteenth century, and the form of the fireplace
belongs altogether to the age of the Renaissance. The gallows,
with its pothooks or crokes of different lengths, appears in our cut
No. 283, taken from Barclay‚Äôs ‚ÄúShip of Fools,‚Äù the edition of 1570,
though the design is somewhat older. The method of attaching the
crooks to one side of the fireplace, when not in use, is exhibited in this
engraving, as also the mode in which other smaller utensils were attached
to the walls. In this latter instance there are no dogs or andirons in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
fireplace, but the pot or boiler is simply placed upon the fire, without
other support. There were, however, other methods of placing the pot
upon the fire; and in one of the curious wooden sculptures in the church
of Kirby Thorpe, in Yorkshire, representing a cook cleaning his dishes,
the boiler is placed over the fire in a sort of four-legged frame, as represented
in the annexed cut <a href="#n284">No. 284</a>.</p>

<p>Early in the seventeenth century the fireplace had taken nearly its
present form, although the dogs or andirons had not yet been superseded
by the grate, which, however, had already come into use. This later
form of the fireplace is shown in our cut <a href="#n285">No. 285</a>, taken from one of an
interesting series of prints, executed by the French artist, Abraham Bosse,
in the year 1633. It represents a domestic party frying fritters in Lent.
One of the dogs is seen at the foot of the opening of the fireplace.

<p class="caption"><i>No. 285. Frying Fritters.</i></p></div>

<p>In the sixteenth century, the articles of furniture in the hall continued
to be much the same as in the century preceding. It continued
to be furnished with hangings of tapestry, but they seem not always to
have been in use; and they were still placed not absolutely against the
wall, but apparently at a little distance from it, so that people might
conceal themselves behind them. If the hall was not a very large
one, a table was placed in the middle, with a long bench on each side.
There was generally a cupboard, or a ‚Äúhutch,‚Äù if not more, with side
tables, one or more chairs, and perhaps a settle, according to the taste or
means of the possessor. We hear now also of tables with leaves, and of
folding tables, as well as of counters, or desks, for writing, and dressers,
or small cupboards. The two latter articles were evidently, from their
names, borrowed from the French. Cushions were also kept in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
hall, for the seats of the principal persons of the household, or for the
females. The furniture of the hall of William Lawson, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
in 1551, consisted of one table of wainscot, valued at twenty
shillings, two double counters, valued together at thirty shillings, a drawer
and two forms, estimated at five shillings, two cushions and two chairs,
also valued at five shillings, five other cushions, valued at twelve shillings,
two carpet cloths and a cupboard cloth, valued together at ten shillings,
and the hangings in the hall, estimated to be worth fifty shillings. This
seems to have been a very well furnished hall; that of Robert Goodchild,
parish clerk of St. Andrew‚Äôs in Newcastle, in 1557, contained an almery
(or large cupboard), estimated at ten shillings; a counter ‚Äúof the myddell
bynde,‚Äù six shillings; a cupboard, three shillings and fourpence; five basins
and six lavers, eight shillings; seventeen ‚Äúpowder (<i>pewter</i>) doblers,‚Äù
seventeen shillings; six pewter dishes and a hand-basin, five shillings;
six pewter saucers, eighteen pence; four pottle pots, five shillings and
fourpence, three pint pots and three quart pots, three shillings; ten candlesticks,
six shillings; a little pestle and a mortar, two shillings; three
old chairs, eighteen pence; six old cushions, two shillings; and two
counter-cloths. Much of the furniture of English houses at this time
was imported from Flanders. Jane Lawson, in the year last mentioned,
had in her hall at Little Burdon in Northumberland, ‚ÄúFlanders counters
with their carpets.‚Äù She had also in the hall, a long side table, three long
forms and another form, two chairs, three stools, six new cushions and
three old cushions, and an almery. The whole furniture of the hall of
the rectory house of Sedgefield in Durham, which appears to have been
a large house and well entertained, consisted of a table of plane-tree with
joined frame, two tables of fir with frames, two forms, a settle, and a pair
of trestles. The hall of Bertram Anderson, a rich and distinguished
merchant and alderman of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in 1570, was furnished
with two tables with the carpets (<i>table-covers</i>), three forms, one dozen
cushions, half-a-dozen green cushions, one counter with the carpet, two
‚Äúbasinges‚Äù (<i>basins</i>), and two covers, one chair, and one little chair. This
is a striking proof of the rarity of chairs even at this late date. Buffet
stools, which are supposed to be the stools with a flat top and a hole in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
the middle through which the hand might be passed to lift them, are
also mentioned among the articles of furniture in the hall at this period.
The furniture of the hall at the manor-house of Croxdale, in the county
of Durham, in the year 1571, consisted of one cupboard, one table, two
buffet stools, and one chair; yet Salvin of Croxdale was looked upon as
one of the principal gentry of the Palatinate. In enumerating the furniture
of the ancient hall, we must not forget the arms which were usually
displayed there, especially by such as had dependent upon them a certain
number of men whom it was their duty or their pride to arm. The hall
of a rich merchant of Newcastle, named John Wilkinson, contained in
1571, the following furniture: one almery, one table of wainscot, one
counter, one little counter, one dresser of wainscot, one ‚Äúpulk,‚Äù three
chairs, three forms, three buffet stools, six cushions of tapestry, six old
cushions of tapestry, six green cushions, two long carpet cloths, two
short carpet cloths, one say carpet cloth, the ‚Äúhyngars‚Äù in the hall, on
the almery head one basin and ewer, one great charger, three new
‚Äúdoblers,‚Äù one little chest for sugar, and one pair of wainscot tables; and
of arms, two jacks, three sallets of iron, one bow and two sheaves of
arrows, three bills, and two halberts. Some of the entries in these
inventories are amusing; and, while speaking of arms, it may be stated,
that a widow lady of Bury, Mary Chapman, who would appear to have
been a warlike dame, making her will in 1649, leaves to one of her sons,
among other things, ‚Äúalso <i>my</i> muskett, rest, bandileers, sword, and headpiece,
<i>my</i> jacke, a fine paire of sheets, and a hutche.‚Äù In 1577, Thomas
Liddell, merchant of Newcastle, had in his hall, ‚Äúthree tables of waynscoot,
sex qwyshons of tapestery, a cowborde, three wainscoot formes, two
chayrs, three green table clothes, fower footstoles, sixe quyshons, two
candlesticks, a louckinge glasse, sexe danske pootts of powther (<i>pewter</i>),
two basings, and two vewers (<i>ewers</i>), a laver and a basinge, fyve buffatt
stules.‚Äù It is curious thus to trace the furniture of the hall at different
periods, and compare them together; and we cannot but remark from
the frequency with which the epithet <i>old</i> is applied to different articles,
towards the end of the century that the hall was beginning rapidly to
fall into disuse. The cause of this was no doubt the increasing taste for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
domestic retirement, and the wish to withdraw from the publicity which
had always attended the hall, and it gradually became the mere entrance
lobby of the house, the place where strangers or others were allowed to
remain until their presence had been announced, which is the sense in
which we commonly use the word hall, as part of the house, at the
present day. In the enumeration of the parts of a house given in the
English edition of Comenius‚Äôs ‚ÄúJanua Linguarum,‚Äù in the middle of
the seventeenth century, there is no mention of a hall. ‚ÄúA house,‚Äù we
are told in this quaint book, ‚Äúis divided into inner rooms, such as are the
entry, the stove, the kitchen, the buttery, the dining-room, the gallery,
the bed-chamber, with a privy made by it; baskets are of use for carrying
things to and fro; and chests (which are made fast with a key) for
keeping them. The floor is under the roof. In the yard is a well, a
stable, and a bath. Under the house is the cellar.‚Äù</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 286. A Folding Table.</i></p></div>

<p>It has already been remarked that tables with leaves began to be
mentioned frequently after the commencement of the sixteenth century.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
Andrew Cranewise, of Bury, in 1558, enumerates ‚Äúone cupborde in the
hall, one plaine table with one leafe.‚Äù He speaks further on, in the
same will, of ‚Äúmy best folte (<i>fold or folding</i>) table in the hall, and two
great hutches.‚Äù In 1556, Richard Claxton, of Old Park, in the county
of Durham, speaks of a ‚Äúfolden table‚Äù in the parlours, which was valued
at two shillings. These folding tables appear to have been made in a
great variety of forms, some of which were very ingenious. Our cut
No. 286 represents a very curious folding table of the sixteenth century,
which was long preserved at Flaxton Hall, in Suffolk, but perished in the
fire when that mansion was burnt a few years ago. As represented in
the cut, which shows the table folded up so as to be laid aside, the legs
pull out, and the one to the right fits into the lion‚Äôs mouth, and is secured
by the pin which hangs beside it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n287" src="images/i_n287.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 287. Cresset and Moon.</i></p></div>

<p>The methods of lighting the hall at night were still rather clumsy,
and not very perfect. Of course, when the apartment was very large, a
few candles would produce comparatively little effect, and it was therefore
found necessary to use torches, and inflammable masses of larger size.
One method of supplying the deficiency was to take a small pan, or portable
fireplace, filled with combustibles, and suspend it in the place where
light was required. Such a receptacle was usually placed at the top of a
pole, for facility of carrying about, and was called a cresset, from an old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
French word which meant a night-lamp. The cresset is mentioned by
Shakespeare and other writers as though it were chiefly used in processions
at night, and by watchmen and guides. The first figure in our cut
No. 287, taken from Douce‚Äôs ‚ÄúIllustrations of Shakespeare,‚Äù represents
one of the cressets carried by the marching watch of London in the
sixteenth century. From the continual mention of the cresset along with
the fire-irons of the hall, in the wills published by the Surtees Society,
we can hardly doubt its being used, at least in the north of England, for
lighting the hall itself. An improvement of the common cresset consisted
in enclosing the flame, by whatever material it was fed, in a case
made of some transparent substance, such as horn, and thus making it
neither more nor less than a large lantern fixed on the end of a pole.
The form of this implement was generally globular, and, no doubt from
its appearance when carried in the night, it was denominated a <i>moon</i>.
The ‚Äúmoon‚Äù was carried by servants before the carriages of their masters,
to guide them along country lanes, and under other similar circumstances.
The second figure in our cut <a href="#n287">No. 287</a> represents a ‚Äúmoon‚Äù which was
formerly preserved at Ightham Moat House, in Kent; the frame was of
brass, and the covering of horn. To assist in lighting the hall, sometimes
candlesticks were fixed to the walls round the hall, and this perhaps will
explain the rather large number of candlesticks sometimes enumerated
among the articles in that part of the house. In our cut <a href="#n282">No. 282</a>, we
have an example of a candlestick placed on a frame, which, turning on a
pivot or hinges, may be turned back against the wall when not in use.</p>

<p>During the period of which we are now speaking, almost everything
connected with the table underwent great change. This was least the
case with regard to the hours of meals. The usual hour of breakfast was
seven o‚Äôclock in the morning, and seems scarcely to have varied. During
the sixteenth century, the hour of dinner was eleven o‚Äôclock, or just four
hours after breakfast. ‚ÄúWith us,‚Äù says Harrison in his description of
England, prefixed to Holinshed‚Äôs Chronicle, ‚Äúthe nobilitie, gentrie, and
students (he means the Universities), doo ordinarilie go to dinner at
eleven before noone, and to supper at five, or between five and sixe, at
afternoone.‚Äù Before the end of the century, however, the dinner hour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
appears to have varied between eleven and twelve. In a book entitled
the ‚ÄúHaven of Health,‚Äù written by a physician named Cogan, and
printed in 1584, we are told: ‚ÄúWhen foure houres be past after breakefast,
a man may safely take his dinner, and the most convenient time
for dinner is about eleven of the clocke before noone. The usual time
for dinner in the universities is at eleven, or elsewhere about noon.‚Äù
In Beaumont and Fletcher, the hour of dinner was still eleven; ‚ÄúI never
come into my dining-room,‚Äù says Merrythought, in the ‚ÄúKnight of the
Burning Pestle,‚Äù ‚Äúbut at eleven and six o‚Äôclock.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat hour is‚Äôt,
Lollis?‚Äù asks a character in the ‚ÄúChangeling,‚Äù by their contemporary
Middleton. ‚ÄúTowards eating-hour, sir.‚Äù ‚ÄúDinnertime? thou mean‚Äôst
twelve o‚Äôclock.‚Äù And other writers at the beginning of the seventeenth
century speak of twelve o‚Äôclock and seven as the hours of dinner and
supper. This continued to be the usual hour of dinner at the close of the
same century.</p>

<p>During the reign of Elizabeth, and afterwards, persons of both sexes
appear to have broken their fast in the same substantial manner as was
observed by the Percies at the beginning of the century, and as described
in a previous chapter; yet, though generally but four hours interposed
between this and the hour of dinner, people seem to have thought it
necessary to take a small luncheon in the interval, which, no doubt from
its consisting chiefly in drinking, was called a <i>bever</i>. ‚ÄúAt ten,‚Äù says a
character in one of Middleton‚Äôs plays, ‚Äúwe drink, that‚Äôs mouth-hour; at
eleven, lay about us for victuals, that‚Äôs hand-hour; at twelve, go to
dinner, that‚Äôs eating-hour.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour gallants,‚Äù says Appetitus, in the old
play of ‚ÄúLingua,‚Äù ‚Äúnever sup, breakfast, nor bever without me.‚Äù</p>

<p>The dinner was the largest and most ceremonious meal of the day.
The hearty character of this meal is remarked by a foreign traveller in
England, who published his ‚ÄúM√©moires et Observations‚Äù in French in
1698. ‚ÄúLes Anglois,‚Äù he tells us, ‚Äúmangent beaucoup √† diner; ils mangent
√† reprises, et remplissent le sac. Leur souper est leger. Gloutons √†
midi, fort sobres au soir.‚Äù In the sixteenth century, dinner still began
with the same ceremonious washing of hands as formerly; and there was
considerable ostentation in the ewers and basins used for this purpose.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
Our cut <a href="#n288">No. 288</a> represents ornamental articles of this description, of the
sixteenth century, taken from an engraving in Whitney‚Äôs ‚ÄúEmblems,‚Äù printed
in 1586. This custom was rendered more necessary by the circumstance
that at table people of all ranks used
their fingers for the purposes to which
we now apply a fork. This article
was not used in England for the
purpose to which it is now applied,
until the reign of James I. It is true
that we have instances of forks even
so far back as the pagan Anglo-Saxon
period, but they are often found
coupled with spoons, and on considering
all the circumstances, I am led to the conviction that they were
in no instance used for feeding, but merely for serving, as we still serve
salad and other articles, taking them out of basin or dish with a fork and
spoon. In fact, to those who have not been taught the use of it, a fork
must necessarily be a very awkward and inconvenient instrument. We
know that the use of forks came from Italy, the country to which England
owed many of the new fashions of the beginning of the seventeenth
century. It is curious to read Coryat‚Äôs account of the usage of forks at
table as he first saw it in that country in the course of his travels. ‚ÄúI
observed,‚Äù says he, ‚Äúa custome in all those Italian cities and townes
through which I passed, that is not used in any other country that I saw
in my travels, neither doe I thinke that any other nation of Christendome
doth use it, but only Italy. The Italian, and also most strangers that are
commorant in Italy, doe alwaies at their meales use a little forke, when
they cut their meate. For while with their knife which they hold in
one hande they cut the meat out of the dish, they fasten their forke,
which they hold in their other hande, upon the same dish, so that whatsoever
he be that sitting in the company of any others at meale, should
unadvisedly touch the dish of meate with his fingers, from which all at
the table do cut, he will give occasion of offence unto the company, as
having transgressed the lawes of good manners, insomuch that for his error
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
he shall be at the least brow-beaten, if not reprehended in wordes. This
forme of feeding I understand is generally used in all places of Italy, their
forkes being for the most part made of yron or steele, and some of silver,
but those are used only by gentlemen. The reason of this their curiosity
is, because the Italian cannot by any means indure to have his dish
touched with fingers, seeing all men‚Äôs fingers are not alike cleane. Hereupon
I myself thought good to imitate the Italian fashion by this forked
cutting of meate, not only while I was in Italy, but also in Germany, and
oftentimes in England since I came home; being once quipped for that
frequent using of my forke by a certain learned gentleman, a familiar
friend of mine, one Mr. Lawrence Whittaker, who in his merry humour
doubted not to call me at table <i>furcifer</i>, only for using a forke at feeding,
but for no other cause.‚Äù <i>Furcifer</i>, in Latin, it need hardly be observed,
meant literally one who carries a fork, but its proper signification was, a
villain who deserves the gallows.</p>

<p>The usage of forks thus introduced into England, appears soon to have
become common. It is alluded to more than once in Beaumont and
Fletcher, and in Ben Jonson, but always as a foreign fashion. In Jonson‚Äôs
comedy of ‚ÄúThe Devil is an Ass,‚Äù we have the following dialogue:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Meerc. <i>Have I deserv‚Äôd this from you two, for all</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My pains at court to get you each a patent?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Gilt. <i>For what?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Meerc. <i>Upon my project o‚Äô the forks.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sle. <i>Forks? what be they?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Meerc. <i>The laudable use of forks,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Brought into custom here, as they are in Italy,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To th‚Äô sparing o‚Äô napkins.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

In fact the new invention rendered the washing of hands no longer so
necessary as before, and though it was still continued as a polite form
before sitting down to dinner, the practice of washing the hands after
dinner appears to have been entirely discontinued.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
‚ÄúWhen a feast is made ready,‚Äù we are told, ‚Äúthe table is covered with a
carpet and a table-cloth by the waiters, who besides lay the trenchers,
spoons, knives, with little forks, table napkins, bread, with a saltsellar.
Messes are brought in platters, a pie in a plate. The guests being brought
in by the host, wash their hands, out of a laver or ewer, over a hand-basin,
or bowl, and wipe them with a hand-towel; then they sit at the table on
chairs. The carver breaketh up the good cheer, and divideth it. Sauces
are set amongst roste-meat in sawsers. The butler filleth strong wine out
of a cruse, or wine-pot, or flagon, into cups, or glasses, which stand on a
cup-board, and he reacheth them to the master of the feast, who drinketh
to his guests.‚Äù It will be observed that one salt-cellar is here placed in
the middle of the table. This was the usual custom; and, as one long
table had been substituted for the several tables formerly standing in the
hall, the salt-cellar was considered to divide the table into two distinct
parts, guests of more distinction being placed above the salt, while the
places below the salt were assigned to inferiors and dependants. This
usage is often alluded to in the old dramatists. Thus, in Ben Jonson, it
is said of a man who treats his inferiors with scorn, ‚Äúhe never drinks
<i>below the salt</i>,‚Äù <i>i.e.</i>, he never exchanges civilities with those who sit at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
the lower end of the table. And in a contemporary writer, it is described
as a mark of presumption in an inferior member of the household ‚Äúto sit
above the salt.‚Äù Our cut <a href="#n290">No. 290</a>, taken from an engraving by the
French artist, Abraham Bosse, published in 1633, represents one of the
first steps in the laying out of the dinner-table. The plates, it will be
seen, are laid, and the salt-cellar is duly placed in the middle of the table.
The servant is now placing the napkins&mdash;</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 290. Laying out the Dinner-table, 1633.</i></p></div>

<p>The earlier half of the sixteenth century was the period when the
pageantry of feasting was carried to its greatest degree of splendour. In
the houses of the noble and wealthy, the dinner itself was laid out with
great pomp, was almost always accompanied with music, and was not
unfrequently interrupted with dances, mummings, and masquerades. A
picture of a grand feast carried on in this manner is given in one of the
illustrations to the German work on the exploits of the emperor Maximilian,
published at the time under the title of ‚ÄúDer Weiss Kunig.‚Äù
An abridged copy of this engraving is given in our cut <a href="#n291">No. 291</a>. The
table profusely furnished, the rich display of plate on the cupboards, the
band in front, and the mummers entering the hall, are all strikingly characteristic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
of the age. The dresser, or cupboard, was now one of the
great means of display among the higher orders of society, who invested
vast wealth in its furniture, consisting of vessels made of the precious
metals and of crystal, sometimes set with precious stones, and often
adorned with the most beautiful sculpture, or moulded into singular or
elaborate forms. So much attention was given to the arrangement of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
the plate on the dresser, and to the ceremonies attending it, that it was
made a point of etiquette how many steps, or gradations, on which the
rows of plate were raised one above another, members of each particular
rank of society might have on their cupboards. Thus, a prince of royal
blood only might have five steps to his cupboard; four were allowed to
nobles of the highest rank, three to nobles under that of duke, two to
knights-bannerets, and one to persons who were merely of gentle blood.
These rules, however, were probably not universally obeyed. It was
the duty of the butler to have charge of the plate in the hall, and his
station there was usually at the side of the cupboard, as in the engraving
taken from ‚ÄúDer Weiss Kunig‚Äù (<a href="#n291">No. 291</a>). Comparatively few examples
of the domestic plate of an early period have survived the revolutions of
so many ages, during which they were often melted for the metal, and
those which remain are chiefly in the possession of corporations or public
bodies; but several fine collections of the ornamental plate of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries have been made, and among these one of the
best and most interesting is that of the late lord Londesborough, now in
the possession of lady Londesborough.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>A dinner scene on a smaller scale is represented in our next cut
(<a href="#n292">No. 292</a>), copied from one in which Albert Durer represents Herodias
dancing and performing before Herod at his solitary meal. This
pageantry at dinner was succeeded, and apparently soon superseded, in
the higher society by masques after dinner, which continued to be very
fashionable until the breaking out of the civil commotions in the middle
of the seventeenth century. During the period of the Protectorate and
the Commonwealth, the forms of eating and drinking were much simplified,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
and all that expensive ostentation, which had arisen in the high
times of feudal power, and had become burthensome to the aristocracy
after it had been weakened by the reigns of the Tudors, disappeared.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 292. Herodias dancing before Herod.</i></p></div>

<p>The regular order of service at dinner seems to have been still three
courses, each consisting of a number and variety of dishes, according to
the richness of the entertainment. To judge from the early cookery
books, which have been described in a former chapter, our ancestors,
previous to the sixteenth century, in the better classes of society, were not
in the habit of placing substantial joints on the table, but instead of them
had a great variety of made dishes, a considerable proportion of which
were eaten with a spoon. At the tables of the great, there was a large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
attendance of servants, and the guests were counted off not, as before, in
couples, but in fours, each four being considered as one party, under the
title of a <i>mess</i>, and probably having a dish among them, and served by
one attendant. This custom is often alluded to in the dramatists, and it
is hardly necessary to observe that it was the origin of our modern term
in the army. The plate, as well as the porcelain and earthenware, used
at table during the greater part of this period, was so richly diversified,
that it would require a volume to describe it, nor would it be easy to pick
out a small number of examples that might illustrate the whole. Our
cut <a href="#n293">No. 293</a> represents a peculiar article of this period, which is not undeserving
of remark, two knife-cases, made of leather, stamped and gilt.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it will be seen that our popular saying of
‚Äúthe roast beef of old England,‚Äù is not so literally true as we are
accustomed to suppose. While, however, the style of living we have
been describing prevailed generally among the higher ranks and the
richer portion of the middle classes, particularly in towns, that of the less
affluent classes remained simple and even scanty, and a large portion of
the population of the country probably indulged in flesh meat only at
intervals, or on occasions when they received it in their lord‚Äôs kitchen or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
hall. A few plain jugs, such as those represented in our cut <a href="#n294">No. 294</a>,
taken from a wooden sculpture in the church of Kirby Thorpe, in
Yorkshire, with platters or trenchers in pewter or wood, formed the
whole table service of the inferior classes. It was the revolution in the
middle of the seventeenth century which
first abolished this extravagant ostentation,
and brought into fashion a plainer table and
more substantial meats. A foreigner, who
had been much in England in the latter
part of the seventeenth century, and published
his observations in French at the Hague
in 1698, tells us that the English of that
period were great eaters of meat&mdash;‚ÄúI have
heard,‚Äù says he, ‚Äúof many people in England
who have never eaten bread, and ordinarily
they eat very little; they nibble sometimes a
little bit, while they eat flesh by great mouthfuls.
Generally speaking, the tables are not
served with delicacy in England. There are some great lords who have
French and English cooks, and where you are served much in the French
fashion; but among persons of the middle condition of which I am speaking,
they have ten or twelve sorts of common meat, which infallibly come
round again in their turns at different times, and of two dishes of which
their dinner is composed, as for instance, a pudding, and a piece of roast
beef. Sometimes they will have a piece boiled, and then it has always
lain in salt some days, and is flanked all round with five or six mounds of
cabbage, carrots, turnips, or some other herbs or roots, seasoned with salt and
pepper, with melted butter poured over them. At other times they will
have a leg of mutton, roasted or boiled, and accompanied with the same
delicacies; poultry, sucking pigs, tripe, and beef tongues, rabbits, pigeons,
all well soaked with butter, without bacon. Two of these dishes, always
served one after the other, make the ordinary dinner of a good gentleman,
or of a good burgher. When they have boiled meat, there is
sometimes somebody who takes a fancy to broth, which consists of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
water in which the meat has been boiled, mixed with a little oatmeal,
with some leaves of thyme, or sage, or other such small herbs. The
pudding is a thing which it would be difficult to describe, on account of
the diversity of sorts. Flour, milk, eggs, butter, sugar, fat, marrow,
rasins, &amp;c. &amp;c., are the more common ingredients of a pudding. It is
baked in an oven; or boiled with the meat; or cooked in fifty other
fashions. And they are grateful for the invention of puddings, for it is a
manna to everybody‚Äôs taste, and a better manna than that of the dessert,
inasmuch as they are never tired of it. Oh! what an excellent thing is
an English pudding! <i>To come in pudding time</i>, is a proverbial phrase,
meaning, to come at the happiest moment in the world. Make a
pudding for an Englishman, and you will regale him be he where he will.
Their dessert needs no mention, for it consists only of a bit of cheese.
Fruit is only found at the houses of great people, and only among few of
them.‚Äù The phrase, ‚Äúto come in pudding time,‚Äù occurs as early as the
beginning of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The absence of the dessert at the English table, of which the writer
just quoted complains, arose from the abandonment in the middle of the
seventeenth century of an old custom. In the earlier part of that century,
and in the century previous, when the company rose from the dinner-table,
they proceeded to what was then called the <i>banquet</i>, which was
held in another apartment, and often in an arbour in the garden, or, as it
was called, the garden-house. The <i>banquet</i> of an earlier period, the
fifteenth century, was, as we have already seen, a meal after supper. In
Massinger‚Äôs play of the ‚ÄúCity Madam,‚Äù a sumptuous dinner is described
as follows:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The dishes were raised one upon another,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>As woodmongers do billets, for the first,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The second, and third course; and most of the shops</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Of the best confectioners in London ransack‚Äôd</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To furnish out a banquet.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

In another of Massinger‚Äôs dramas, one of the characters says:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>We‚Äôll dine in the great room, but let the musick</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And banquet be prepared here.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>

It appears, therefore, that the banquet was often accompanied with
music. At the banquet the choice wines were brought forth, and the
table was covered with pastry and sweetmeats, of which our forefathers at
this period appear to have been extremely fond. A usual article at the
banquet was marchpanes, or biscuits made of sugar and almonds, in
different fanciful forms, such as men, animals, houses, &amp;c. There was
generally one at least in the form of a castle, which the ladies and gentlemen
were to batter to pieces in frolic, by attacking it with sugar-plums.
Taylor, the water-poet, calls them&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Castles for ladies, and for carpet knights,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Unmercifully spoil‚Äôd at feasting fights,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Where battering bullets are fine sugred plums.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

On festive occasions, and among people who loved to pass their time at
table, the regular banquet seems to have been followed by a second, or,
as it was called, a <i>rere-banquet</i>. These rere-banquets are mentioned by
the later Elizabethan writers, generally as extravagances, and sometimes
with the epithet of ‚Äúlate,‚Äù so that perhaps they took the place of the
soberer supper. People are spoken of as taking ‚Äúsomewhat plentifully of
wine‚Äù at these rere-banquets. The rere-supper was still in use, and appears
also to have been a meal distinguished by its profusion both in eating and
drinking. It was from the rere-supper that the roaring-boys, and other
wild gallants of the earlier part of the seventeenth century, sallied forth
to create noise and riot in the streets.</p>

<p>One of the great characteristics of the dinner-table at this period was
the formality of drinking, especially that of drinking healths, so much
cried down by the Puritans. This formality was enforced with great
strictness and ceremony. It was not exactly the modern practice of giving
a toast, but each person in turn rose, named some one to whom he individually
drank (not one of the persons present), and emptied his cup.
‚ÄúHe that begins the health,‚Äù we are told in a little book published in
1623, ‚Äúfirst, uncovering his head, he takes a full cup in his hand, and
setting his countenance with a grave aspect, he craves for audience;
silence being once obtained, he begins to breathe out the name, per-adventure,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
of some honourable personage, whose health is drunk to, and
he that pledges must likewise off with his cap, kiss his fingers, and bow
himself in sign of a reverent acceptance. When the leader sees his
follower thus prepared, he sups up his broth, turns the bottom of the cup
upward, and, in ostentation of his dexterity, gives the cup a phillip to
make it cry twango. And thus the first scene is acted. The cup being
newly replenished to the breadth of a hair, he that is the pledger must
now begin his part, and thus it goes round throughout the whole company.‚Äù
In order to ascertain that each person had fairly drunk off his
cup, in turning it up he was to pour all that remained in it on his nail,
and if there were too much to remain as a drop on the nail without
running off, he was made to drink his cup full again. This was termed
drinking on the nail, for which convivialists invented a mock Latin phrase,
and called it drinking <i>super nagulum</i>, or <i>super-naculum</i>.</p>

<p>This custom of pledging in drinking was as old as the times of the
Anglo-Saxons, when it existed in the ‚Äúw√¶s heil‚Äù and ‚Äúdrinc heil,‚Äù
commemorated in the story of the British Vortigern and the Saxon
Rowena, and it is alluded to in several ballads of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries, as in that of ‚ÄúKing Edward and the Shepherd,‚Äù
where the man who drinks pledges his companion with the word ‚Äúpasselodion,‚Äù
and the other replies by ‚Äúberafrynde,‚Äù and in that of ‚ÄúThe
Kyng and the Hermyt,‚Äù where the words of pledging and reply are
‚Äúfusty bandyas,‚Äù and ‚Äústryke pautnere.‚Äù Both these ballads are printed
in Hartshorne‚Äôs ‚ÄúAncient Metrical Tales.‚Äù The drinking of the healths
of absent individuals appears to have been introduced at a later period,
and was carried to its greatest degree of extravagance on the continent.
The person whose health a man gave was usually expected to be his
mistress; and in France he was expected, in doing this, to drink as many
times his glass or cup full of wine as there were letters in her name.
Thus, in Ronsard‚Äôs ‚ÄúBacchanales,‚Äù the gallant drinks nine times to his
mistress Cassandre, because there were nine letters in her name:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Neuf fois, au nom de Cassandre,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>Je vois prendre</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Neuf fois du vin du flacon;</i><br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Affin de neuf fois le boire</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>En memoire</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Des neuf lettres de son nom.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

And a less celebrated poet, of a rather later date, Guillaume Colletet, in
a piece entitled ‚ÄúLe Trebuchement de l‚ÄôIvrongne,‚Äù printed at Paris
in 1627, introduces one of his personages drinking six times to his mistress,
because her name was Cloris:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Six fois je m‚Äôen vas boire au beau nom de Cloris,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Cloris, le seul desir de ma chaste pens√©e.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The manner of pledging at table, as it still existed in England, is
described rather ludicrously in the ‚ÄúMemoires d‚ÄôAngleterre,‚Äù of the year
1698, already quoted. ‚ÄúWhile in France,‚Äù the author says, ‚Äúthe custom
of drinking healths is almost abolished among people of any distinction, as
being equally importunate and ridiculous, it exists here in all its ancient
force. To drink at table, without drinking to the health of some one in
especial, among ordinary people, would be considered as drinking on the
sly, and as an act of incivility. There are in this proceeding two principal
and singular grimaces, which are universally observed among people
of all orders and all sorts. It is, that the person to whose health another
drinks, if he be of inferior condition, or even equal, to that of him who
drinks, must remain as inactive as a statue while the drinker drinks. If,
for instance, he is in the act of taking something from a dish, he must
suddenly stop, return his fork or spoon to its place, and wait, without
stirring more than a stone, until the other has drunk; after which, the
second grimace is to make him an <i>inclinabo</i>, at the risk of dipping his
perriwig in the gravy in his plate. I confess that, when a foreigner first
sees these manners, he thinks them laughable. Nothing appears so droll
as to see a man who is in the act of chewing a morsel which he has in his
mouth, of cutting his bread, of wiping his mouth, or of doing anything
else, who suddenly takes a serious air, when a person of some respectability
drinks to his health, looks fixedly at this person, and becomes as motionless
as if a universal paralysis had seized him, or he had been struck by a
thunderbolt. It is true that, as good manners absolutely demand this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
respectful immobility in the <i>patient</i>, it requires also a little circumspection
in the <i>agent</i>. When any one will drink to the health of another, he must
fix his eye upon him for a moment, and give him the time, if it be
possible, to swallow his morsel.‚Äù It is hardly necessary to observe that
this custom is the origin of our modern practice of ‚Äútaking wine‚Äù with
each other at table, which is now also becoming obsolete.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">As</span> social peace and security became more established in the country,
people began to be more lavish in all the articles of household
furniture, which thus became much more numerous during the period of
which we are now treating. It also went through its fashions and its
changes, but in the progress of these changes it became less ponderous
and more elegant. Until the middle of the sixteenth century, and
perhaps later in some parts of the island, where social progress was slower,
the old arrangements of a board laid upon trestles for a table still prevailed,
though it was gradually disappearing; and, although the term of
‚Äúlaying‚Äù the board in a literal sense was no longer applicable, it has
continued to be used figuratively, even to our own times. Richard
Kanam, of Soham, in the county of Cambridge, whose will was proved
so late as the 12th of April, 1570, left, among other household furniture,
‚Äúone table with a payer of tressels, and a thicke forme.‚Äù The first step
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
in the change from tables of this kind appears to have been to fix the
trestles to the board, thus making it a permanent table. The whole was
strengthened by a bar running from trestle to trestle, and ornamental
wood-work was afterwards substituted in place of the trestles. A rather
good example of a table of this description is given in the cut on the
preceding page (<a href="#n295">No. 295</a>), taken from that well-known publication, the
‚ÄúStultifera Navis‚Äù of Sebastian Brandt. This, however, was a clumsy
construction, and it soon gave way to the table with legs, the latter
being usually turned on the lathe, and sometimes richly carved. This
carving went out of use in the unostentatious days of the Commonwealth
and the Protectorate, to make way for plain table legs, and it never
quite recovered its place.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 296. Henry VIII‚Äôs Chair.</i></p></div>

<p>We have seen already that in the latter part of the previous century,
in the chairs and stools, the joinery work of Flanders was taking the place
of the older rude and clumsy seats. This taste still prevailed in the
earlier half of the sixteenth century, and a large proportion of the
furniture used in this country, as well as of the earthenware and other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
household implements, during the greater part of that century, were
imported from Flanders and the Netherlands. Hence, in the absence of
engravings at home, we are led to look at the works of the Flemish and
German artists for illustrations of domestic manners at this period. The
seats of the description just mentioned were termed joint (or joined)
stools or chairs. A rather fine example of a chair of this work, which is,
as was often the case, three-cornered, is preserved in the Ashmolean
Museum at Oxford, where it is reported to have been the chair of
Henry VIII., on what authority I know not. It is represented in our
cut <a href="#n296">No. 296</a>. These ‚Äújoined‚Äù chairs and stools were laid aside for
furniture of a more elegant form, which was used during the reign of
Elizabeth and her immediate successors, and of which examples are so
common that it is hardly necessary
to give one here. This fashion appears
to have been brought from France.
An example of rather peculiar style
is given in our cut <a href="#n297">No. 297</a>, taken
from a picture executed in 1587, representing
Louis de Gonzagues, duke of
Nivernois.</p>

<div class="figright"><img id="n297" src="images/i_n297.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 297. Chair of duke de Nivernois.</i></p></div>

<p>Hitherto the cushions were merely
adjuncts to the chairs, but by another
advance in convenience the cushion
was soon made as a part of the chair
or stool, which at the same time became
simpler in form again. Our cut
No. 298, taken from one of the prints
of Abraham Bosse, dated in 1633,
represents the general character of the chairs and stools used in France
at that date, as they are drawn in the works of this artist, and
also the manner in which they were arranged round a room when
not in use. On the left appears the end of a cushioned bench, which
was generally of the length of two or three stools, and appears as a
common article of furniture. Among other articles of furniture now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
introduced was the couch, or, as we should call it, the sofa. This was
called, in the age of Shakespeare, a day-bed, and appears to have been in
some discredit, as an article indicating excess of luxury. Large cupboards,
usually termed court-cupboards, and often very richly carved, were
now in general use, for containing, under lock and key, the plate and
other valuables. In allusion to the carvings on these cupboards, which
usually consisted of faces more or less grotesque, and not very artistically
executed, Corbet, in his ‚ÄúIter Boreale,‚Äù speaks of a person&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>With a lean visage, like a carv‚Äôd face</i><br /></span>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 298. Stools and Chairs of the age of Charles I.</i></p></div>

<p>The sixteenth century was especially the age of tapestries, and no
gentleman could consider his rooms furnished if they wanted these
important adjuncts. They were now elaborately worked into great
historical pictures, sacred or profane, or mythological or other subjects, to
suit the varieties of tastes. Sir John Elyot, in his ‚ÄúGovernor,‚Äù reminds
his readers that ‚Äúsemblable decking oughte to bee in the house of a
noblemanne, or man of honoure; I meane concerning ornaments of hall
and chambers in arras, painted tables, and images concernynge historyes,
wherein is represented some monument of vertue most cunningly,‚Äù &amp;c.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
At the commencement of the seventeenth century this practice was
already beginning to go out of fashion, and it was not long afterwards
that it was entirely laid aside: and the walls were again covered with
panels, or painted or whitewashed, and adorned with pictures. In our
last cut, of the date of 1633, we see the walls thus decorated with
paintings.</p>

<div class="figright"><img id="n299" src="images/i_n299.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 299. A Chandelier of the Sixteenth Century.</i></p></div>

<p>The rapid social revolution which was now going on, gradually produced
changes in most of the articles of domestic economy. Thus, the
old spiked candlestick was early in the
century superseded by the modern
socket candlestick. The chandelier
represented in our cut <a href="#n299">No. 299</a>, taken
from one of Albert Durer‚Äôs prints of
the Life of the Virgin, published in
1509, in its spikes for the candles
and its other characteristics, belongs
to a ruder and earlier style of household
furniture, and has nothing in
common with the rich chandeliers
which now began to be used.</p>

<p>The parlour appears in the sixteenth
century to have been a room
the particular use of which was in
a state of transition. Subsequently,
as domestic life assumed greater privacy than when people lived publicly
in the hall, the parlour became the living room; but in the sixteenth
century, though in London it was already used as the dining-room, in
the country it appears to have been considered as a sort of amalgamation
of a store-room and a bedroom. This is best understood from the
different inventories of its furniture which have been preserved. In
1558, the parlour of Robert Hyndmer, rector of Sedgefield, in the county
of Durham, contained&mdash;‚Äúa table with a joined frame, two forms, and a
carpet; carved cupboards; a plain cupboard; nine joined stools; hangings
of tapestry; and a turned chair.‚Äù In the parlour at Hilton Castle, in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
same county, in 1559, there were&mdash;‚Äúone iron chimney, two tables, one
counter, two chairs, one cupboard, six forms, two old carpets, and three
old hangings.‚Äù In 1564, Margaret Cottom, a widow of Gateshead, had
in her parlour&mdash;‚Äúone inner bed of wainscot, a stand, a bed, a presser of
wainscot, three chests, a Dantzic coffer;‚Äù a considerable quantity of linen
and cloth of different kinds, and for different purposes; ‚Äútallow candles,
and wooden dishes, a feather bed, a bolster, and a cod (<i>pillow</i>), two coverlets,
two happgings (<i>coverlets of a coarser kind</i>), three blankets, three
cods (<i>pillows</i>), with an old mattress; five cushions, a steel cap, and a
covering; a tin bottle, a cap-case with a lock.‚Äù In the house of William
Dalton, a wealthy merchant of Durham in 1556, the parlour must have
been very roomy indeed to contain all the ‚Äúhousehold stuff‚Äù which it
holds in the inventory, namely, ‚Äúa chimney, with a pair of tongs; a bedstead
close made; a feather bed, a pair of sheets, a covering of apparels,
an ‚Äòovese‚Äô bed, a covering wrought of silk; a cod (<i>pillow</i>), and a pillow-bere;
a trundle-bed, a feather bed, a twilt (<i>quilt</i>), a happing (<i>coverlet</i>),
and a bolster; a stand-bed, a feather-bed, a mattress, a pair of blankets, a
red covering, a bolster, and curtains; eight cods, and eight pillow-beres;
seven pair of linen sheets; eight pair of strakin (<i>a sort of kersey</i>) sheets;
six pair of harden (<i>hempen</i>) sheets; thirteen yards of diaper tabling;
ten yards and a half of table-cloth; twenty-one yards of towelling; four
hand towels; two dozen napkins; five pillow-beres; two head sheets;
a pair of blankets; two ‚Äòoverse‚Äô beds, and three curtains; a cupboard;
a table, with a carpet; a counter, with a carpet; a Dantzic chest; a bond
chest; a bond coffer; an ambry; a long settle, and a chair; three buffet
stools; a little stool; two forms; red hangings; a painted cloth; three
chests; a stand-bed, a pair of blankets, two sheets, a covering, and two
cods; an ‚Äòambre call.‚Äô‚Äù In 1567, the parlour at Beaumont Hill, a
gentleman‚Äôs house in the north, contained the following furniture:&mdash;‚ÄúOne
trundle bed, with a feather bed; two coverlets, a bolster, two
blankets, two carpet table cloths, two coverlets, one presser, a little table,
one chest, three chairs, and three forms.‚Äù In other inventories, down
to the end of the century, we find the parlour continuing to be stored
in this indiscriminate manner.

<p class="caption"><i>No. 302. A Time-piece, &amp;c.</i></p></div>

<p>This period also differs from former periods in the much greater
number of beds, and greater abundance of bed-furniture, we find in the
houses. We have often several beds in one chamber. Few of the principal
bedrooms had less than two beds. The form of the bedstead was
now almost universally that with four posts. Still in the engravings of
the sixteenth century, we find the old couch-bed represented. Such
appears to be the bed in our cut <a href="#n300">No. 300</a>, taken from Whitney‚Äôs ‚ÄúEmblems,‚Äù
an English book printed at Leyden in 1586. We have here
another, and rather a late example, of the manner in which money was
hoarded up in chests in the chambers. The couch-bed is still more
distinctly shown in our cut <a href="#n301">No. 301</a>, taken from Albert Durer‚Äôs print of
St. Jerome, dated in 1511. This print is remarkable for its detail of the
furniture of a bed-chamber, and especially for the manner in which the
various smaller articles are arranged and suspended to the walls. Not
the least remarkable of these articles is the singular combination of a
clock and an hour glass, which is placed against the wall as a time-piece.
This seems, however, to have been not uncommon. A time-piece of the
same kind is represented in our cut <a href="#n302">No. 302</a>, which is taken from a print
of St. Jerome at prayer, by Hans Springen Kelle, without date, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
evidently belonging to the earlier half of the sixteenth century. The
method of suspending or attaching to the walls the smaller articles in
common use, such as scissors, brushes, pens,
papers, &amp;c., is here the same as in the
former. Our next cut (<a href="#n303">No. 303</a>), from a
print by Aldegraver, dated in 1553, represents
evidently a large four-post bedstead,
which is remarkable for its full and flowing
curtains. The plate appears here to
be kept in the bed-chamber. Chests, cupboards,
presses, &amp;c., become now very
numerous in the bedrooms, and we begin
to meet with tables and chairs more frequently.
In 1567, the principal chamber in the house of Mrs. Elizabeth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
Hutton, at Hunwick, contained the following articles:&mdash;‚ÄúIn napery, in
linen sheets, sixteen pair; certain old harden (<i>hempen</i>) sheets, and sixteen
pillowberes; two Dantzic chests, a little chest bound with iron, a
candle chest, and another old chest; a press with two floors and five
doors; a folding table, seven little cushions, and two long cushions of
crool (<i>a sort of fine worsted</i>) wrought with the needle, and a carpet cloth
that is in working with crools for the same; six feather beds, with six
bolsters, and a coarse feather-bed tick; eight mattresses, and nine bolsters;
twelve pillows, twelve pair of blankets, and six happings; twenty coverlets,
three coverings for beds of tapestry, and two of dornix (<i>Tournay</i>);
a carpet cloth of tapestry work, five yards long, and a quarter deep; five
standing beds, with cords; two testers with curtains of saye, and two
testers with curtains of crool.‚Äù In the principal chamber in the house of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
lady Catherine Hedworth, in 1568, the following furniture is enumerated:&mdash;‚ÄúOne
trussing bed, one feather bed, one pair of blankets, one
pair of sheets, one bolster, one pillow with a housewife‚Äôs covering, four
pillows, two Flanders chests, one almery, two cupboards, three coffers,
two cupboard stools, three buffet forms, one little buffet stool, two little
coffers, five mugs, three old cushions.‚Äù The principal chamber of Thomas
Sparke, suffragan bishop of Berwick, whose goods were appraised in 1572,
was furnished with the following articles:&mdash;‚ÄúA stand-bed, with a testron
of red saye and fringe, and a truckle-bed; a Cypres chest, a Flanders
chest, a desk, three buffet stools; the said chamber hung with red saye.‚Äù
At Crook Hall, in the suburbs of Durham, in 1577, the principal chamber
contained three beds; another chamber contained four beds; and a third
two beds. These lists furnish good illustrations of the various prints from
which we have already given some sketches.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
Another of his prints, of the same date, has furnished us with a sketch of
a bedroom party (cut <a href="#n305">No. 305</a>), which is no unapt illustration of domestic
manners in the seventeenth century. It represents a custom which prevailed
especially in France. A woman, after childbirth, kept her room
in state, and with great ceremony, and received there daily her female
acquaintances, who passed the afternoon in gossip. This practice, and
especially the conversation which took place at it, were frequent subjects
of popular satire, and formed the groundwork of one of the most celebrated
books of the reign of Louis XIII., entitled ‚ÄúLes Caquets de
l‚ÄôAccouch√©e,‚Äù first published in 1622. An edition of this curious satire
has been recently published by M. Ed. Fournier, in the introduction to
which, as well as in the text, the reader will find abundant information
on this subject.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">During</span> the period at which we are now arrived, almost all the
relations of domestic life underwent a great change, and nothing
hardly could produce a wider difference than that between the manners
and sentiments of the reign of Henry VII., and those of Charles II.
This was especially observable in the occupations of the female sex, which
were becoming more and more frivolous. At the earlier portion of the
period referred to, women in general were confined closely to their
domestic labours, in spinning, weaving, embroidering, and other work of
a similar kind. A hand-loom was
almost a necessary article of furniture
in a well regulated household, and
spinning was so universal an occupation,
that we read sometimes of an
apartment in the house set apart for
it&mdash;a family spinning room. Even to
this present day, in legal language,
the only occupation acknowledged,
as that of an unmarried woman, is
that of a spinster. Our cut (<a href="#n306">No. 306</a>)
represents a party of ladies at their
domestic labours; it is taken from
Israel van Mechelin‚Äôs print of ‚ÄúThe Virgin Ascending the Steps of the
Temple,‚Äù where this domestic scene is introduced in a side compartment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
Two are engaged at the distaff, the old poetical emblem of the sex.
Another is cutting out the cloth for working, with a pair of shears of very
antiquated form. The shape of the three-cornered joined chair in this
group is worthy of remark. The female in our cut <a href="#n307">No. 307</a> is also seated
in a chair of rather peculiar construction, though it has occurred before at
an earlier period (cut <a href="#n245">No. 245</a>, p. 375), and we meet with it again in our
next cut (<a href="#n308">No. 308</a>). It is what was sometimes called a folding chair.
This cut is taken from one of the illustrations to the English edition of
Erasmus‚Äôs ‚ÄúPraise of Folly,‚Äù printed in 1676, but it is a copy of the
earlier originals. The great weaving establishments in England appear to
have commenced in the sixteenth century, with the Protestant refugees
from France and the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The old domestic games continued to be practised in the middle and
upper classes of society, although they were rather extensively superseded
by the pernicious rage for gambling which now prevailed throughout
English society. This practice had been extending itself ever since the
beginning of the fifteenth century, and had been accompanied with
another evil practice among the ladies, that of drinking. It need hardly
be observed that these two vices furnished constant themes to the dramatists
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
and satirists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; the example set
by the court under James I. caused them to increase greatly, and they
rose to the highest pitch of extravagance under Charles II. Barclay‚Äôs
‚ÄúShip of Fools‚Äù (the early English edition) has furnished us with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
group of female gamesters, represented in our cut <a href="#n308">No. 308</a>. It will be
seen that the ladies are playing with cards and dice, and that the ale jug
is introduced as an accompaniment. In fact we must look upon it as a
tavern party, and the round table, as far as we can judge, appears to be
fixed in the ground. The same book furnishes us with an illustration
(cut <a href="#n309">No. 309</a>), in which two gamblers are quarrelling over a game at
backgammon. A child is here the jug-bearer or guardian of the liquor.
Our cut <a href="#n310">No. 310</a> represents a gambling scene of a rather later period,
taken from Whitney‚Äôs ‚ÄúEmblems,‚Äù printed in 1586; dice are here the
implements of play.</p>

<p>A very curious piece of painted glass, now in the possession of Mr.
Fairholt, of German manufacture, and forming part, apparently, of a
series illustrative of the history of the Prodigal Son, represents a party
of gamblers, of the earlier part of the sixteenth century, in which
they are playing with two dice. It is copied in our cut <a href="#n311">No. 311</a>. The
original bears the inscription, ‚Äú<i>Jan Van Hassell Tryngen sin hausfrau</i>,‚Äù
with a merchant‚Äôs mark, and the date, 1532. Three dice, however,
continued to be used long after this, and are, from time to time, alluded
to during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p>I have, in a former chapter, traced the history of playing-cards down
to the latter half of the fifteenth century. After that time, they are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
frequently mentioned. They formed the common amusement in the
courts of Scotland and England under the reigns of Henry VII. and
James IV.; and it is recorded that when the latter monarch paid his first
visit to his affianced bride, the young princess Margaret of England, ‚Äúhe
founde the quene playing at the cardes.‚Äù</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 311. A Gambling Party of the Sixteenth Century.</i></p></div>

<p>In Germany at this time card-playing was carried to an extravagant
degree, and it became an object of attack and satire to the reformers
among the clergy. Our cut <a href="#n312">No. 312</a> represents a German card-party in
a tavern, taken from an early painted coffer in the Museum of Old
German Art at Nuremberg. The design of the cards is that of packs of
fancifully ornamented cards made in Germany at the close of the fifteenth
century. The German satirists of that age complain that the rage for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
gambling had taken possession of all classes of society, and levelled all
ranks, ages, and sexes; that the noble gambled with the commoner, and
the clergy with the laity. Some of the clerical reformers declared that
card-playing as well as dice was a deadly sin, and others complained
that this love of gambling had caused people to forget all honourable
pursuits.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>No. 312. Cards early in the Sixteenth Century.</i></p></div>

<p>A similar outcry was raised in our own country; and a few years later
it arose equally loud. A short anonymous poem on the ruin of the realm,
belonging apparently to the earlier part of the reign of Henry VIII.
(MS. Harl. No. 2252, fol. 25, v<sup>o</sup>), complains of the nobles and gentry:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Before thys tyme they lovyd for to juste,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>And in shotynge chefely they sett ther mynde,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And ther landys and possessyons now sett they moste,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>And at cardes and dyce ye may them ffynde.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

‚ÄúCardes and dyce‚Äù are from this time forward spoken of as the great
blot on contemporary manners; and they seem for a long time to have
driven most other games out of use. Roy, in his remarkable satire against
cardinal Wolsey, complains that the bishops themselves were addicted to
gambling:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>To play at the cardes and dyce</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Some of theym are no thynge nyce,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Both at hasard and mom-chaunce.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The rage for cards and dice prevailed equally in Scotland. Sir David
Lindsay‚Äôs popish parson, in 1535, boasts of his skill in these games:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Thoch I preich nocht, I can play at the caiche;</i><br /></span>

<p>Though gardening and horticulture in general, as arts, were undergoing
considerable improvement during this period, the garden itself
appears to have been much more neglected, except as far as it was the
scene of other pastimes. A bowling-green was the most important part
of the pleasure garden in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; and
bowls, and exercises of a similar character, were the favourite amusements
of all classes. The gardens themselves, which were apart from the house,
and made more retired by lofty walls enclosing them, were usually
adorned with alcoves and summer-houses, or, as they were then more
usually termed, garden-houses, but these were chiefly celebrated, especially
in the seventeenth century, as places of intrigue. There are
continual allusions to this usage in the popular writers of the time.
Thus, one of the personages in Beaumont and Fletcher‚Äôs ‚ÄúWoman Hater‚Äù
exclaims, ‚ÄúThis is no garden-house: in my conscience she went forth
with no dishonest intent.‚Äù And, in the play of the ‚ÄúMayor of Quinsborough,‚Äù&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Poor soul, she‚Äôs entic‚Äôd forth by her own sex</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To be betray‚Äôd to man, who in some garden-house,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or remote walk, taking his lustful time,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Binds darkness on her eyes, surprises her.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>

A character in another old play, ‚ÄúThe London Prodigal,‚Äù seeking employment
of a rather equivocal character, says, ‚ÄúNow God thank you,
sweet lady, if you have any friend, or garden-house, where you may
employ a poor gentleman as your friend, I am yours to command in all
secret service.‚Äù</p>

<p>Amid the gaiety which was so especially characteristic of this age, a
spirit of vulgar barbarity had arisen and spread itself very widely, and the
popular games most practised were in general coarse and cruel. A foreign
writer already quoted, but one who was evidently a very unprejudiced
observer, has left us some rather amusing remarks on this subject which
are worthy of being repeated. ‚ÄúThe English,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúhave games
which are peculiar to them, or at least, which they affect and practise
more than people do elsewhere. To see cocks fight is a royal
pleasure in England. Their combats of bulls and dogs, of bears and dogs,
and sometimes of bulls and bears, are not combats to the last gasp, like
those of cocks. Everything that is called fighting is a delicious thing to
an Englishman. If two little boys quarrel in a street, the passers stop,
make in a moment a ring round them, and encourage them to settle it
by blows of the fist. If it comes to fighting, each takes off his cravat and
his jacket, and gives them in charge to one of the company; then begin
the blows of the fist, in the face if possible, the blows of the foot on their
shins, the pulling of one another by the hair, &amp;c. The one who has
knocked the other down, may give him one blow or two when he is
down, but no more, and every time the one who is down will rise,
the other must return to the combat as long as he pleases. During
the combat, the circle of spectators encourage the combatants to the
great joy of their hearts, and never separate them, so long as things are
done according to rule. And these spectators are not only other children,
and street porters, but all sorts of respectable people, some of whom make
their way through the crowd to see nearer, others mount upon the shops,
and all would pay for places, if stages could be built up in a moment.
The fathers and mothers of the little boys who are fighting look on like
the others, and encourage the one who gives way, or is wanting in
strength. These kind of combats are less frequent among grown-up men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
than among children, but they are not uncommon. If the driver of a
hackney-coach has a dispute about his fare, with a gentleman whom he
has carried, and the gentleman offers to settle the dispute by fighting, the
coachman agrees to it willingly. The gentleman takes off his sword,
disposes of it in some shop with his walking-stick, his gloves, and his
cravat, and fights in the manner I have described. If the coachman is
well beaten, which is almost always the case, he is considered as paid;
but if he beats, he who is beaten must pay the sum that was in question,
and that which caused the quarrel. I once saw the late duke of Grafton
fighting in the open street in the middle of the Strand with a coachman,
whom he thrashed in a terrible manner. In France, we treat such kind
of people with blows of a stick or, sometimes, of the flat of the sword;
but in England that is never done; they never use a sword or stick against
those who are not similarly armed; and if any unlucky foreigner (for it
would never come into the mind of an Englishman) should strike with
the sword any one who had not got one, it is certain that in an instant
a hundred persons would fall upon him, and perhaps beat him so that
he would never recover. Wrestling is also one of the diversions of the
English, especially in the northern provinces. Ringing the bells is one
of their great pleasures, especially in the country; there is a way of
doing it, but their peal is quite different from those of Holland and the
Low Countries. In winter football is a useful and charming exercise; it
is a ball of leather, as large as a man‚Äôs head, and filled with wind; it is
tossed with the feet in the streets. To expose a cock in a place, and kill
it at a distance of forty or fifty paces with a stick, is also a very diverting
thing; but this pleasure only belongs to a certain season. This also is
the case with the dances of the milkwomen, with the throwing at one
another of tennis-balls by girls, and with divers other little exercises.‚Äù
Such was the rude character of the amusement of all classes of our
population during the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The ladies still had their household pets, though they varied sometimes
in their character, which perhaps arose in some measure from the
circumstance that the discovery of or increased communication with
distant countries, brought the knowledge of animals and birds which were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
not so well known before. Thus, in the sixteenth century, monkeys
appear to have been much in fashion as domestic favourites, and we not
unfrequently find them in prints in attendance upon ladies. Since the
discovery of the West Indies, and the voyages of the Portuguese to the
coast of Africa, parrots had become much more common than formerly.
In pictures of the period of which we are speaking,
we often find these, as well as smaller
domestic birds, in cages of various forms. In our
cut <a href="#n313">No. 313</a>, taken from Whitney‚Äôs ‚ÄúEmblems‚Äù
(printed in 1585), we have a parrot in its cage,
and a small bird (perhaps meant for a canary),
the latter of which is drawing up its water to
drink in a manner which has been practised in
modern times, and supposed to be a novelty.
It is very unsafe indeed to assume that any ingenious contrivances of this
kind are modern, for we often meet with them unexpectedly at a comparatively
early date.</p>

<div class="figright"><img id="n313" src="images/i_n313.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 313. Birds and Birdcage.</i></p></div>

<p>With the multiplicity of new fashions in dress now introduced, the
work of the toilette became much greater and more varied, and many
customs were introduced from France, from Italy, and from the East.
Among customs derived from the latter quarter, was the introduction of
the eastern hot and sweating baths, which became for a considerable
period common in England. They were usually known by the plain
English name of <i>hothouses</i>, but their eastern origin was also sometimes
indicated by the preservation of their Persian name of <i>hummums</i>. This
name is still retained by the two modern hotels which occupy the sites of
establishments of this description in Covent Garden. Sweating in hothouses
is spoken of by Ben Jonson; and a character in the old play of
‚ÄúThe Puritan,‚Äù speaking of a laborious undertaking, says, ‚ÄúMarry, it will
take me much sweat; I were better go to sixteen <i>hothouses</i>.‚Äù They seem
to have been mostly frequented by women, and became, as in the East,
favourite places of rendezvous for gossip and company. They were soon
used to such an extent for illicit intrigues, that the name of a hothouse or
bagnio became equivalent to that of a brothel; and this circumstance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
probably led eventually to their disuse. A very rare and curious broadside
woodcut of the reign of James I., entitled ‚ÄúTittle-tattle, or the several
branches of gossipping,‚Äù which in different compartments represents
pictorially the way in which the women of that age idled away their
time, gives in one part a sketch of the interior of a hothouse, which is
copied in our cut <a href="#n314">No. 314</a>. In one division of the hothouse the ladies
are bathing in tubs, while they are indulging themselves with an abundance
of very substantial dainties; in the other, they appear to be still
more busily engaged in gossip. The whole broadside is a singularly
interesting illustration of contemporary manners. A copy of it will be
found in the print-room of the British Museum; and it may be remarked
(which I think has not been observed before), that it is copied from a
large French etching of about the same period, a copy of which is in the
print department of the Imperial Library in Paris.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n314" src="images/i_n314.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 314. A Hothouse.</i></p></div>

<p>This is sufficient to show the close resemblance at this time between
manners in France and in England. In the former country, the resort of
women in company to the hot-baths is not unfrequently alluded to, and
their behaviour and conversation there are described in terms of satire
which cannot always be transferred to our modern pages. In these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
popular satires, the bathers are sometimes <i>chambri√®res</i>, and at others good
<i>bourgeoises</i>. The pic-nics, which had formerly taken place at the tavern,
were now transferred to the hot-bath, each of a party of bathers carrying
some contribution to the feast, which they shared in common. Thus, in
the popular piece entitled ‚ÄúLe Banquet des Chambri√®res fait aux
Estuves,‚Äù printed in 1541, it is the chamber-maidens who go to the
bath, and they begin immediately to produce their contributions, one
exclaiming&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&mdash;<i>j‚Äôay du porc frais,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Une andouille et quatre saulcices.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

To which a second adds,&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&mdash;<i>j‚Äôaye une cottelette,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Qui le ventre quasi m‚Äôeschaulde.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

And a third,&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Moy, un past√© √† sauce chaulde.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

The women are seen eating their pic-nic feast in one compartment of our
cut. This practice soon passed from the servant maids of the bourgeoisie
to their mistresses, and from the burghers‚Äô wives to ladies of higher
condition. Our word pic-nic, representing the French <i>piquenique</i>, the
origin or derivation of which word seems not to be clearly known,
appears to have come into use at the latter end of the last century, when
people of rank formed evening parties at which they joined in such
pic-nic suppers, to which each brought his or her contribution. The
term is now applied almost solely to such collations in the fields, or in the
open air.</p>

<p>We have already seen how, at an earlier period, men of a superior
rank in London, and probably in at least the larger country towns, lived
much in the taverns and cooks‚Äô shops or eating-houses. This practice
continued, and underwent various modifications, the principal of which
was the establishment of houses where a public table was served at
fixed hours, at which a gentleman could take his place on payment of a
certain sum, much in the same style as our modern <i>tables d‚Äôh√¥te</i>. Gradually
these establishments became gambling-houses, and men settled down after
dinner to cards, dice, and other games. They were called ordinaries, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
in the reign of Elizabeth they had become an important part of the social
system. It was here that people went to hear the news of the day, or
the talk of the town, and to frequent the ordinary became gradually
considered as a necessary part of the education of a gentleman of fashion.
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, the usual price of an ordinary
appears to have been two shillings; but there were ordinaries at
eighteen-pence, and at some fashionable ordinaries the price was much
higher.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="n315" src="images/i_n315.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 315. Swaddling a Child.</i></p></div>

<p>The general treatment of children, their costume, and their amusements,
remained much as formerly, and closely resembled those of France
and Germany as they were then, and as they have existed in some parts
even to our own days. The pernicious practice of swathing or swaddling
the child as soon as it was born prevailed everywhere, and the infant was
kept in this condition until it became necessary to teach it the use of its
limbs. The process of swaddling is shown in our cut <a href="#n315">No. 315</a>, taken from
one of the prints by Bosse, published in 1633, which furnish such abundant
illustration of contemporary manners. The period during which boys
were kept in petticoats was very short, for at a very early age they were
dressed in the same dress as up-grown people, like little miniature men.
Our only representatives of the appearance of little boys in the sixteenth
century, is found in one or two educational establishments, such as the
Blue-Coat School in London. The costume of a child during the short
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
transition period between his swathes and his breeches is represented in
our cut <a href="#n316">No. 316</a>, of a boy riding upon his wooden horse. It is taken
from a German woodcut of the date of 1549.</p>

<div class="figright"><img id="n316" src="images/i_n316.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>No. 316. <i>A Boy a-cock-horse.</i></i></p></div>

<p>In the sixteenth century little improvement had taken place in the
means of locomotion, which was still performed
generally on horseback. Coaches,
by that name, are said to have been
introduced into England only towards
the middle of the sixteenth century.
They were made in various forms and
sizes, according to fashion or caprice, and
towards the end of the century they were
divided into two classes, known by the
foreign names of <i>coaches</i> and <i>caroches</i>.
The latter appear to have been larger
and clumsier than the former, but to have
been considered more stately; and from the old play of ‚ÄúTu Quoque,‚Äù
by Green (a drama of Elizabeth‚Äôs reign), we learn that it was considered
more appropriate to the town (and probably to the court), while the
<i>coach</i> was left to the country:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Nay, for a need, out of his easy nature,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>May‚Äôst draw him to the keeping of a coach</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For country, and carroch for London.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ben Jonson, in his comedy of ‚ÄúThe Devil is an Ass,‚Äù gives us a great
notion of the bustle attending a <i>caroch</i>:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Have with them for the great caroch, six horses,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And the two coachmen, with my ambler bare,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And my three women.</i><br /></span>
</span></span>

Coaches of any kind, however, were evidently not in very common use
until after the beginning of the seventeenth century. Women in general,
at least those who were not skilful horsewomen, when the distance or any
other circumstance precluded their going on foot, rode on a pillion or
side-saddle behind a man, one of her relatives or friends, or sometimes a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
servant. The accompanying cut (<a href="#n317">No. 317</a>) represents a couple thus
mounted, the lady holding in her hand the kind of fan which was used
at the period. From a comparison of the figure of the Anglo-Saxon
ladies on horseback, who were evidently seated in the saddle as in a chair,
sideways to the horse, we are led to suppose that the Anglo-Saxon lady‚Äôs
saddle, and probably the saddle for females in general during the middle
ages, was the same as that which was known in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, by the name of a pillion. The rider placed her feet
usually on a narrow board, which was called in French the <i>planchette</i>.
It is evident that a woman could not be very solidly seated in this
manner, and not only did she want the command over the horse which
would enable her to take part in any very active exercises, but it was
considered almost necessary to place a man on a saddle before her. We
have, accordingly, seen that, from a very early period, when engaged in
hunting and in any sort of active riding, the lady used a saddle, as at
present, in which she raised one leg over a part of the saddle-bow, made
for that purpose, and placed the other foot in the stirrup, by which she
obtained a firm seat, and a command over the horse. Different writers
have ascribed, without any reason, the introduction of this mode of riding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
for ladies to various individuals, and Brant√¥me seems to have thought
that this practice was first brought into fashion by Catherine de Medicis.
The last cut is taken from a drawing in the curious Album of Charles de
Bousy, containing dates from 1608 to 1638, and now preserved among
the Sloane manuscripts (No. 3415) in the British Museum; and the
same manuscript has also furnished us with the annexed cut (<a href="#n318">No. 318</a>) of
a lady of rank carried in her chair, with her chair-bearers and attendants.
Ladies, and especially persons suffering from illness, were often carried in
horse-litters, and there are instances of chairs mounted somewhat like the
one here represented, and carried by horses. The first attempt towards
the modern gig or cabriolet appears to have been a chair fixed in a cart,
something in the style of that represented in our cut <a href="#n319">No. 319</a>, which in
its ornamentation has a very medi√¶val character, although it is given as
from a manuscript in the Imperial Library in Paris (No. 6808), of the
beginning of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The close of the period of which we are here speaking introduces us
to one in which the manners and customs of our forefathers were less
widely different from those of our own days; and the history of domestic
manners since that time, characterised less by broad outline of the general
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
features in its revolutions than by a gradual succession of minute changes,
and fashions which must be traced from day to day, is less capable of
being treated in the comprehensive style of these pages. Having now,
therefore, brought down our sketch of the History of the Domestic Manners
of our forefathers to the middle of the seventeenth century, we shall here,
for the reason just stated, conclude it, and leave to some worthier labourer,
or to some future occasion, the task of tracing more minutely the history
of domestic manners and sentiments during the period which followed
the middle ages.</p>

<span class="large table">FROM THE GALLERIES AND PRIVATE COLLECTIONS<br />

</h2>

<p>It is designed to succeed the ‚Äú<span class="smcap">Royal Gallery</span>‚Äù and the ‚Äú<span class="smcap">Vernon Gallery</span>;‚Äù
and, there can be no doubt, will be superior in interest to either. In the
‚ÄúVernon Gallery‚Äù are many pictures not calculated for engraving; but they were
necessarily included in the published work, in order to redeem a pledge given to
Mr. Vernon, to publish the <i>whole</i> of his gallery bequeathed to the Nation; while,
in engraving the ‚ÄúRoyal Gallery‚Äù it was considered necessary, in order to represent
somewhat duly its varied contents, to introduce examples of some of the old masters,
in which the collections are exceedingly rich, although engravings from them were
not likely to be as extensively popular as prints from modern works.</p>

<p>In the series now announced, no such restriction or difficulty can arise: the
power of selection will be almost unlimited; and the result will depend on the taste
and judgment that dictate its contents.</p>

<p>Some of these selections have been made from public galleries, others from large
and important collections, but the greater number have been obtained from the
comparatively small, though rich and varied, collections of private gentlemen&mdash;‚Äúthe
merchant princes‚Äù more especially, who have, of late years, been the chief patrons
of British Art&mdash;whose wealth has been liberally expended in elevating British Art
to its present state of high prosperity.</p>

<p>An ‚Äú<span class="smcap">Illustrated Catalogue of the International Exhibition of
1862</span>‚Äù will be issued with the Art-Journal, in eight Monthly parts of that
work&mdash;each part consisting of twenty-four illustrated pages containing about one
hundred and twenty engravings.</p>

<p>No extra charge will be made for the <span class="smcap">Art-Journal</span> containing such Illustrated
Catalogue. Nor will any payment be required for the introduction&mdash;with critical
and explanatory notices&mdash;of any object of Art engraved; the proprietors of that
Work believing it to be their first duty to extend, as widely as possible, the knowledge
to be derived from the Exhibition, the instruction it is certain to afford, and
the example and encouragement held out thereby to producers of meritorious
works.</p>

<p>Manufacturers and the public may rest assured that by unceasing efforts, a
judicious and liberal expenditure, and due exercise of the judgment and taste that
result from experience, such an Illustrated Work will be produced, by the combined
efforts of proprietors, editor, artists, and contributors, as cannot fail to be
extremely useful, not alone in Great Britain, but throughout the World. It will
be a report of progress, a volume of suggestions, a teacher from the lessons of many
master-minds, and an enduring reward to those who labour for renown as well as
for the ordinary recompense that is expected to accompany desert.</p>

<p>‚Äú<span class="smcap">The Art-Journal Illustrated Catalogue of 1851</span>‚Äù is so well
known that it is needless to associate with this announcement particulars as to
details. Of that Work 45,000 copies were sold. Certain improvements will be
introduced into the Catalogue of 1862.</p>

<p>In the improvements they project, the proprietors will be largely aided by the
abolition of the duty on paper; the whole of the work will be printed on fine
paper, and will be among the best examples of the printer‚Äôs art. In a word, every
possible effort will be exerted to place the Illustrated Catalogue of the Exhibition
of 1862 among the most remarkable, excellent, and permanently useful productions
which that Exhibition will call into existence, as <span class="smcap">the Illustrated Catalogue
of 1851</span> undoubtedly was, in reference to the Exhibition of that memorable year.</p>

<p>Manufacturers and Art-producers, not only in Great Britain and Ireland, but
in all countries of the World, are hereby invited to communicate with the Editor,
and to assist him with drawings and photographs of works intended to be exhibited
at the International Exhibition in 1862.</p>

The distinction between the <i>waghe</i> and <i>walle</i> continued to a comparatively late
period. Halliwell, ‚ÄúDictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words,‚Äù v. <i>waghe</i>,
quotes the following lines from a manuscript of the fifteenth century&mdash;</p>

It appears not, however, to have been customary to lock the doors during the
absence of the family, but merely to leave some one to take care of the house.
This, at least, was the case in Winchester, as we learn from the miracles of
St. Swithun, by the monk Lantfred.</p></div>

Strutt has engraved, without indicating the manuscript from which it is taken,
a small Saxon house, consisting of one hall or place for living in, with a chamber
attached, exactly like the domestic chapel and its attached chamber in our cut,
No. 12. This seems to have been the usual shape of small houses in the Anglo-Saxon
period.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">4</a>
William of Malmesbury, de Gest. Pontif. printed in Gale, p. 249, describes
the Saxons as cooking their meat <i>in lebete</i>, evidently meaning the sort of vessel
figured in the foregoing cuts. The Latin <i>lebes</i>, a cauldron or kettle, is interpreted
in the early glossaries by the Anglo-Saxon <i>hwer</i>, or <i>huer</i>, from which we derive the
English word <i>ewer</i>; <i>hw√¶r-boll</i> or <i>hw√¶r-cytel</i> are interpreted in the Anglo-Saxon
dictionaries as meaning a frying-pan, which is evidently not correct.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">5</a>
There is one of these knives in the Cambridge Museum, which has been there
rather singularly labelled ‚Äúa Roman razor!‚Äù Mr. Roach Smith always suspected
that these knives were late Saxon, and their similarity in form to those given in the
manuscripts shows that he was correct.</p></div>

This, I suppose, is the meaning of the canon of Alfric (<a href="#n9">No. 9</a>), which allows
a layman to marry, with a dispensation, a second time, ‚Äúif his wife desert him‚Äù
(<i>gyf his w√≠f √¶tfyl√∞</i>) but the priest was not allowed to give his blessing to the
marriage, because it was a case in which the church enjoined a penance, the performance
of which it would be his duty to require. But the meaning of the
Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical laws on this subject is rather obscure.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">12</a>
This fact of family priesthood may perhaps explain a circumstance in the
early history of Northumbria, which has much puzzled some antiquaries; I mean
the story, given by Bede, of the conversion of king Edwin, and of the part acted on
that occasion by the Northumbrian priest Coifi. The place where the priesthood
was held, and where the temple stood, was called Godmundingaham, a name which
it has preserved, slightly modified, to the present day. This name has been the
victim of the most absurd attempts at derivation, which are not worth repeating
here, because every one who knows the Anglo-Saxon language, and anything of
Anglo-Saxon antiquities, is aware that it can only have one meaning&mdash;the home,
or head residence, of the Godmundings, or descendants of Godmund. Perhaps the
priesthood was at this time in the family of the Godmundings, and Coifi may have
been then the head of the family.</p></div>

It is curious that the modern English words play (<i>plega</i>), and game (<i>gamen</i>),
are both derived from the Anglo-Saxon, which perhaps shows that they represent
sentiments we have derived from our Saxon forefathers.</p></div>

This erroneous statement is repeated by most of our writers on such subjects,
and will be found in Mr. Planch√©‚Äôs ‚ÄúHistory of British Costume.‚Äù Statements of
this kind made by old writers are seldom to be depended upon; people were led by
political bias or personal partiality, to ascribe the introduction of customs that were
odious, to persons who were unpopular, or whom they disliked, while they ascribed
everything of a contrary character to persons who were beloved.</p></div>

The word occurs in the reflections of our first parents on their nakedness, in
the poem attributed to C√¶dmon. Adam says that when the inclement weather
arrives (<i>cyme√∞ h√¶gles sc√∫r</i>&mdash;the hail shower will come) they had nothing before them
to serve for a defence or shade against the storm&mdash;</p>

This valuable MS. is preserved in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge.
It is a very remarkable circumstance, which has not hitherto been noticed, that the
illuminations are in general copies from those of the Harleian MS. No. 603, except
that the costume and other circumstances are altered, so that we may take them as
correct representatives of the manners of the Anglo-Normans.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">29</a>
To show the extreme ignorance which has prevailed on the history of English
gardening in the middle ages, it need only be mentioned that Loudon, ‚ÄúEncyclop√¶dia
of Gardening‚Äù (edition of 1850), was not aware that the leek had been
cultivated in England before the time of Tusser, the latter half of the sixteenth
century (p. 854); and states that garlic ‚Äúhas been cultivated in this country since
1548‚Äù (p. 855); and that the radish is ‚Äúan annual, a native of China, and was
mentioned by Gerard in 1584‚Äù (p. 846).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">30</a>
Loudon (p. 887) was not aware that the cultivation of sage dated farther
back than the time of Gerard, who wrote in 1597, and he could trace back to no
older date the cultivation of rue.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">31</a>
Our word <i>chestnut</i> is derived from the Anglo-Saxon <i>cyste-hnutu</i>, the nut of the
cyste-tree. I may remark, on these names of fruits, that Loudon imagined that the
peach was ‚Äúintroduced into England about the middle of the sixteenth century‚Äù
(‚ÄúEncyclop√¶dia of Gardening,‚Äù p. 912); and that of the fig, the ‚Äúfirst trees were
brought over from Italy by Cardinal Pole, in 1525.‚Äù He seems to think that
quinces and mulberries came into this country also in the course of the sixteenth
century.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="label">32</a>
There is, however, an Anglo-Saxon name of a tree which I suspect has been
misinterpreted. The glossaries give ‚Äú<i>ramnus</i>, √æefe-√æorn,‚Äù and our lexicographers,
taking the old sense of the word <i>rhamnus</i>, interpret it, the dog-rose. But in a very
curious glossary of names of plants of the middle of the thirteenth century, printed
in my ‚ÄúVolume of Glossaries,‚Äù in which the meaning of the Latin word is given
in Anglo-Norman and in English, we have ‚Äú<i>Ramni</i>, grosiler, √æefe-√æorn‚Äù (p. 141).
I have no doubt that the thefe-thorn was the gooseberry. In the dialect of Norfolk,
gooseberries are still called <i>theabes</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">33</a>
It may be well to remark, once for all, that it is almost impossible to identify

Dagswain was a sort of rough material of which the commoner sort of coverlets
were made. A hap-harlot or hop-harlot, was also a very coarse kind of
coverlet. Harlot was the term applied to a low class of vagabonds, the ribalds,

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
